We specifically address the critical\nvision-language semantic gap, the \\textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The\nEFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level\n(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a\nspecialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This\ncompact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced\nreasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on\nthe benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent\nLeave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a\nnew state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of\nLLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis.

In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST\nthat couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample\ndomain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D\nsampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while\nother sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing\nvolumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we\npropose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate\nfully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only\nsample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain\ndiscrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that\nfirst aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates\ndense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast\nMulti-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the\nadjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of\nParameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs).

In the second stage, contrastive\nlearning is introduced to align visual and textual representations,\nfacilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect\n16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data.\nMeanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates\nand construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based\non which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive\nlearning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the\neffectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12\nindependent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the\nevaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated\nacross multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification,\ninformation retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various\ndownstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP\nexhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the\nprospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously\ndifficult in real-world scenarios."}

To\naddress these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework\nenhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,\nwe propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:\n1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a\n\"Simple Thinking\" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;\nand 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward\nproblem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present\nDecomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves\ngrounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into\nsmaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and\nScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference\nenhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best\nbaseline on ScreenSpot-Pro."}

While prior datasets have relied on\nstructured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full\nexpressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to\nspatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This\naddresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex,\ndescriptive text, such as \"3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe\", to its precise\nanatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for\ngrounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142\nnon-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the\nCT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to\nextract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented\nby expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were\nannotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists.\nApproximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal.\nThe training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding,\nwhile the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding\nentity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and\nevaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models\nin chest CT.

Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between\nquantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to\nalleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum\ncomputing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of\nfour different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network\nRepresentation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel\nEnhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding\n(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image\ninformation than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off\nbetween accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the\nperformance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear\nkernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable\nclassification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for\nimage storage."}
