Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of\nimages, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This\npaper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive\ngamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of\nthe low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive\ngamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively\nat different illumination levels suitable for the image without human\nintervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative\nevaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved\nlow-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color\ndistribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a\nmore efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple\napplications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical\nimages, and photography in low-light environments."}

MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert\nsubnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB).

A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of\nintraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to\nfactors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and\ntool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of\nview due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative\nVOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds\nas input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder\nallows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel\ndeformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative\ninformation interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We\ntrain the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical\nsimulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real\ndatasets.

Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP\nusing few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been\nbenchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of\nevaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization\nability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP\nmodel, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve\nthis, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true\ninductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a\nsignificant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with\nmultiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle\nbaselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that\nconsistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline\nmethods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the\ndatasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with\ndifferent seeds.

To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively\naggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve\noccupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information\nfrom historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal\naggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal\ninformation aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene\nunderstanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to\naggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal\nfeatures from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective\nperception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and\nglobal temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides\na more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment.

WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining\nfull differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any\ngradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical\nperformance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance\ncompared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on\nchallenging signal and image denoising tasks."}

While prior research has focused\non fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous\nnavigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study\naddresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss\nstructures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces\nseveral approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus\nbackground from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into\ntwo categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical\napproach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the\neigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced\ndeep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3\nare trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that\nthe analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance\ncomparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally\nintensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves\na Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the\npromise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous\nnavigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs\nbetween computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing\nvaluable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous\ninfrastructure inspection and maintenance."}

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the\noriginal training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.\nThrough empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and\nBunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming\nto compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or\nsufficient data."}

Unlike prior approaches\nthat rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require\nmodel-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates\ndirectly within the feature space without retraining or architectural\nmodifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender\nbias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the\nsparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased\ndirection per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed\nduring inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.\nTrained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing\ndirection, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased\nsubspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable\nDiffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially\nreduces gender bias while preserving generation quality.

In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency.
