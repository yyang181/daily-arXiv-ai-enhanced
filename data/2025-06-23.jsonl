Experimental results on two real-world\nlandslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement\nestimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.\nDeviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements\n(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,\nrespectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived\nreferences.

Conducting such an evaluation requires a dataset with sufficient\nlabelled data from both weather conditions, ideally captured in the same\ndriving environment. Current driving datasets with LiDAR point clouds either do\nnot provide enough labelled data in both snowy and clear weather conditions, or\nrely on de-snowing methods to generate synthetic clear weather.

While\nrecent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient\nfacial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical\nand privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable\nmodels across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a\nnovel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving\nessential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a\npretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics\nof real patient faces onto synthetic identities.

To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population\npre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a\nconditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input\nspace of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to\nfine-tune the VMT model backbone.

In this work, we propose Reimagination with\nObservation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that\nenables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world\nscenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable.\nGiven the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by\nidentifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways\nduring world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to\nremove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training\ndistribution. Finally, ReOI \"reimagines\" future outcomes with the modified\nobservation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual\nconsistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach\non a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification,\nwhere the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions\nfrom a world model.

Project page: https://jianglongye.com/dex1b", "summary": "Generating large-scale demonstrations for dexterous hand manipulation remains\nchallenging, and several approaches have been proposed in recent years to\naddress this. Among them, generative models have emerged as a promising\nparadigm, enabling the efficient creation of diverse and physically plausible\ndemonstrations. In this paper, we introduce Dex1B, a large-scale, diverse, and\nhigh-quality demonstration dataset produced with generative models. The dataset\ncontains one billion demonstrations for two fundamental tasks: grasping and\narticulation. To construct it, we propose a generative model that integrates\ngeometric constraints to improve feasibility and applies additional conditions\nto enhance diversity. We validate the model on both established and newly\nintroduced simulation benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness and\nrobustness through real-world robot experiments. Our project page is at\nhttps://jianglongye.com/dex1b"}

Existing methods leverage rich image priors from\npre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic\ndata, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits\ntheir effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane\nsynchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities\ncan be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design,\nwe further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D\npanorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to\nachieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view\nconsistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D\nscene generation."}
