In recent years, advancements in Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new\nheights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,\ntraditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting\npredefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The\nadvent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this\nlimitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can\nidentify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This\nbreakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in\naerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD\nin the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles\nof OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a\nspecialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic\ntaxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides\na comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review\nenables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the\nintersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline\npromising future research directions and application prospects.

Traditional watermarking\ntechniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their\neffectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel\nin-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable\nconcepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable\nwatermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or\nperturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic\nattributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to\nadversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image\naugmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of\nwatermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,\ndemonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining\nimage quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking\ntechniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce\nIConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with\nStegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against\nmultiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique\n(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%\nhigher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)\nscores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on\nvarious datasets."}

We address this gap\nthrough a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs.

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism.

In\nthis paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale\nskin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We\npropose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and\na lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,\nreplay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of\nfrozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers\nwith prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation\nstudies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve\ncompetitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for\ncontinual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real\nworld medical applications.

In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation\nalgorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular\ntissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and\nimplant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these\nstructures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist.\nAdditionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet,\nUNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders.

Four blinded MRI\nprofessionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T\nimages, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due\nto the reduction of artifacts.

However, these degradation kernels, which model the\ntransition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account\nfor not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying\nthe same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be\nimpractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors\nas pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that\nutilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.\nBy employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR\nimage, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process.
