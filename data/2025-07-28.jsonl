While conventional methods require per-instance\noptimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D\nGaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians\nfor each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of\nGaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian\nGraph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,\nso that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable\nhuman representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual\nlayers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the\nsecond layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node\noperation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and\ninter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.\nExperimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation\ndemonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method."}

Generating multi-human\ncontextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among\nhuman-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input\nand convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate\nmulti-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.\nSpecifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a\ndynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a\nwell-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we\nsynthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial\nguidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive\ncontext, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the\nretrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale\nand with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of\ncontextual reasoning.

In this\npaper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device\nusing generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and\ninference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic\nsingle device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions\n-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between\naccuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE\n(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient\ntransformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse\nmodalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,\nprogressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational\nblocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of\ntokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence\nbecomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE\nachieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to\nexisting long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple\nmodalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision."}

To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns.

Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist\nin VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational\nmodels; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world\ndegradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K\nsuper-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with\ninadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a\nhigh-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core\ninnovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated\nwith the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and\nsuppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss)\ncombining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture\nrestoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing\n1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal\nguidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume\ncompared to existing approaches. Extensive experiments on VSR benchmarks (REDS,\nSPMCS, UDM10, YouTube-HQ, VideoLQ, RealisVideo-720P) demonstrate our\nsuperiority, particularly in ultra-high-resolution scenarios."}

While remote physiological\nmeasurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to\nreal-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of\ncomprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality\ndiversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured\nconditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,\nwe present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless\nin-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various\nmodality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,\nincluding synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,\naccompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,\nand SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,\nincluding driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road\nconditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning\nmethods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all\nmodalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream\npublic toolboxes.

To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention\n(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while\nsuppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy.

The\nresulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver\ndataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without\nretraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86\nMRIs, 37 patients).\n  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and\nprompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),\n0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain).

The new model assumes that\nthe feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise\nconstant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to\ncharacterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure.
