To address these\nchallenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a\npre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data\nvia delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an\ninnovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize\nits visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL.

SRE first simulates domain\nshifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated\ntarget domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the\nattention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE\nutilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant\nattention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive\nexperimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally\nachieves better results than state-of-the-art methods.

The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure.

To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated\nvideos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been\ntrained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can\nhelp distinguish real from generated videos.

VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on\nfull-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural\nsimilarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to\ncapture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been\nused, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.\n  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image\nSimilarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining\nevaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell\nmorphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition\nto better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments\ndemonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual\ncues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing\nperceptual metrics tend to overlook.
