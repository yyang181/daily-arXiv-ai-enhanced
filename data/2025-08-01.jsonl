This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD\ninherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as\nin model robustness to some defenses."}

In complex\nenvironments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must\nindependently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust\ndecision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to\nthe large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.\nA key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation\nof the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in\nirregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a\nunified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and\ngenerative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an\ninstance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then\nconstruct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional\nrepresentations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points\nas reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these\nprior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions.

MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to\ndrive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need\nfor specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new\ntargetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features\nand a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side\npoint clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and\nestimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration\nfailures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as\nocclusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the\nV2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness\nand robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to\nprevious LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach\nachieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with\nfewer parameters.

The main challenge lies in inferring unseen\nappearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.\nMost previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;\nhowever, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in\nunrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,\nwe leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by\nsampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the\nlimited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all\nimage details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,\nensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and\nenforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel\napproach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by\nfitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The\ngenerative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,\nenforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation.

Existing learning-based methods focus on\nperforming downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from\nblurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed\nphotonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized\ndownscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent\nreconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of\nwavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in\na coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling\nModule (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to\npreserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution\n(LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency\nenergy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic\nNon-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer\ndownscaling factor of 1.3$\\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available\ndatasets with integer factors (2$\\times$, 3$\\times$, 4$\\times$) for\ncomprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually.
