Specifically, to\nsupport interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary\nPosition Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to\nalign generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables\nfine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of\nfixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we\ndecompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We\nfurther design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it\nleverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and\ntemporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless\nspatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build\ncomprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to\nassess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show\nthat ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher\nfidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity.

However, such\napproaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of\nparallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like\nMamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state\ntransitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while\nmaintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,\nMamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its\ncausal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we\npropose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for\nspatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient\ntemporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an\nalignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame\nwithin the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back\nafterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective\nredistribution of aggregated information across all frames.

One reason for this is the \"prior hole\" problem. A prior\nhole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low\nprobability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,\nhigh probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the\nposterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be\nflexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate\nsamples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff.

In\nthis research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening\nthat enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To\neffectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution\ncalled Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each\ncharacter across different conditioning representation spaces. We further\nobserve that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters\nheavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and\ndiminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present\ntwo solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby\nkeeping synthesis in the stable region of the solution space.We first sustain\ninteraction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through\nadversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to\nrefine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We\ndemonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and\nlong-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and\ndancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative\nevaluations and user studies."}

Methods: The authors propose a new method for\nsearching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images. The proposed method\nconsisted of a segmentation network and a fast search method with a\nuser-controllable search metric. As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose\nencoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used. In the fast search method,\nsummed-area tables were used for accelerating sums of voxels in rectangular\nregions. Use of the summed-area tables enabled exhaustive search of the 3D\noffset (3D full search). The search metric was designed for giving priority to\ncubes over oblongs, and assigning better values for higher tumor fractions even\nif they exceeded target tumor fractions. The proposed computation and metric\nwere compared with those used in a conventional method using the Brain Tumor\nImage Segmentation dataset. Results: When the 3D full search was used, the\nproposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than the conventional\ncomputation (11-40 minutes). When the user-controllable parts of the search\nmetrics were changed variously, the tumor fractions of the proposed metric were\nhigher than those of the conventional metric.
