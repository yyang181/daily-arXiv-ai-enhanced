The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is\ncomputationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler\nin preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization\nperformance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE\nmodel based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them\nusing a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model\noutperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and\ndeep CNN.

However, by building\non recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors\nhave shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from\nindependent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is\nparticularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is\nsignificant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In\nfact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques\nare ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in\nparticular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this\nissue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D\nby fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered\nradiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,\ndynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric\nstructure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the\n(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time\nrefinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing\nthe data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the\nrefinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that\nsurpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques\ncan enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and\nrealistic setting."}

To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question\nanswering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along\nwith corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies\nbetween actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same\nactual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar\ngeometric configuration.

In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can\nextract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of\nCNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer\narchitecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be\nresource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the\nmedical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with\ncompact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using\nViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\\%,\nwhich is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\\%. In this paper,\nwe used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and\nproposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the\nsame organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact\nforeground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in\nMask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based\nauxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss.

However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video\nis composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long\nvideo, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.\nWithout such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy\ntemporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To\nfill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.\nDifferent from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long\nvideos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it\ncan progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into\nthese shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the\nshot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking\nprocess, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for\nthoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our\nVideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long\nvideo QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,\noutperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and\nInternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\\% and 6.2\\%. Compared to leading close-source\nGPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with\n7\\% input frames and 12\\% inference time on average."}

By treating sensing\nmodalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify\nradar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive\ncross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global\ncontrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that\nincorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed\ndistributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both\nclassification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench\nand Copernicus-Bench.

To this end, we\nintroduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust\nInstruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding\nlayers under instruction tuning.

LinGuinE samples points inside\nthis tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.\nA click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;\nthese are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We\ntest LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung\ntumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE\nimproves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63\nlongitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting\npoint, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields\nthe best results on both test datasets."}

Yet, the development of robust and equitable\nmodels remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and\ndemographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from\nregion-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the\nunderrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We\nintroduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising\nover 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient\nclinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified\ndermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a\nhierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The\ndataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation\ncommonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures\nincluding convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),\ntransformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to\nestablish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level\ncues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts\ntoward interpretable and clinically realistic models.

Traditional wound care is\nresource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both\npatients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present\nWoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to\nsupport telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly\ndocument wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians\nremain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video\nconsultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep\nlearning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with\npatient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing\nprogression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving\nboth patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly\ndesign, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with\npatients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and\nfavorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution\nis two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an\neasy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap\nbetween patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for\nremote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of\ninterdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital\nhealth tools across clinical domains."}

In deep learning, a significant\nchallenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced\noptimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient\ndescent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the\nmultitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would\nhinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge\narises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different\nmagnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to\ninterfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient\nsurgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting\ngradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a\nnovel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery\n(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient\nmagnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS\nsurgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order\nmomentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS\non synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays\na crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the\noptimisation of the learning process."}

A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for\nteaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot\naction in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot\nto learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within\ndiverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find\nthat understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical\nclue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for\nboth humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow\nworld model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts\nthe future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action\nplanning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical\nflow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect\npipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics\nfrom these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on\nlanguage instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a\nflow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and\nleverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task\ndescription. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.\nFinally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an\noptimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic\nmanipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without\nhardware-specific training."}

In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks\nconsisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to\ndiscover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and\niterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,\nexploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent\nprogress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings\nremains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a\nlarge-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess\nstep-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is\nannotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive\nskill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic\nanalysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,\nwith the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise\naccuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that\nfine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from\n4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near\nzero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,\nare bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack\nsketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release\nPuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on\nbuilding more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems."}

However, an\ninterpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and\nanalyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding\nspaces. In this work, we propose the \\emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding\nComparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their\ndifferences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel\nmatrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of\nthe difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured\ndifferently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this\nkernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with\nthe sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this\nframework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one\nembedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results\ndemonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on\nlarge-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.
