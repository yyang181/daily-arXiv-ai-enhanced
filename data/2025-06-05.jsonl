In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this\nredundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change\nbetween steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25%\nof the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations\nacross steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic\nsparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate\nactivations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems\nchallenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU\ntensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and\ncaching activations both introduce overhead.

Thus, label\nerrors can significantly reduce classification accuracy. Since label errors are\ninevitable in realistic learning tasks, improving the robustness of the model\nin the presence of label errors is critical. This paper proposes a new robust\nneural field-based image approach (RoNFA) for few-shot image classification\nwith noisy labels. RoNFA consists of two neural fields for feature and category\nrepresentation. They correspond to the feature space and category set. Each\nneuron in the field for category representation (FCR) has a receptive field\n(RF) on the field for feature representation (FFR) centered at the\nrepresentative neuron for its category generated by soft clustering. In the\nprediction stage, the range of these receptive fields adapts according to the\nneuronal activation in FCR to ensure prediction accuracy. These learning\nstrategies provide the proposed model with excellent few-shot learning\ncapability and strong robustness against label noises. The experimental results\non real-world FSL datasets with three different types of label noise\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nFSL methods. Its accuracy obtained in the presence of noisy labels even\nsurpasses the results obtained by state-of-the-art FSL methods trained on clean\nsupport sets, indicating its strong robustness against noisy labels."}

We argue that a robust object referring model\nshould be grounded, meaning its predictions should be both explainable and\nfaithful to the visual content. Specifically, it should satisfy two key\nproperties: 1) Verifiable, by producing interpretable reasoning that justifies\nits predictions and clearly links them to visual evidence; and 2) Trustworthy,\nby learning to abstain when no object in the image satisfies the given\nexpression. However, most methods treat referring as a direct bounding box\nprediction task, offering limited interpretability and struggling to reject\nexpressions with no matching object. In this work, we propose Rex-Thinker, a\nmodel that formulates object referring as an explicit CoT reasoning task. Given\na referring expression, we first identify all candidate object instances\ncorresponding to the referred object category. Rex-Thinker then performs\nstep-by-step reasoning over each candidate to assess whether it matches the\ngiven expression, before making a final prediction.

We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key\nsources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within\ncontext condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent\ninteractions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we\npropose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general\ncontrollability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates\nfrom two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2\nleverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important\ncontext tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.\nAdditionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize\nredundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive\nexperiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks\ndemonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3\ntimes speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal\ndegradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

Previous methods often rely on task-specific\narchitectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations\n(e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing\nconditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we\nintroduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective\nframework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an\nin-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of\nvarious video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens,\nthe noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary\naccording to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key\ninsight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token\nsequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT,\nthereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless,\ndirect task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe\ntoken collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and\ndiverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce\ntask-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and\ncondition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different\nediting tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video\nediting tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens \"in\ncontext\", and support flexible task composition. To validate our method, we\nconstruct a unified video editing benchmark containing six representative video\nediting tasks. Results demonstrate that our unified approach achieves superior\nperformance on each task and exhibits emergent task composition abilities."}

Traditional photoacoustic\n(PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data,\nproduce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not\nconsider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution\nis crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by\nthe low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser\ntechnology.

Such\nmethods train a diffusion model (without sinogram data) on high-quality, but\nstill noisy, PET images. In this work, we propose a simple method for\ngenerating subject-specific PET images from a dataset of multi-subject PET-MR\nscans, synthesizing \"pseudo-PET\" images by transforming between different\npatients' anatomy using image registration. The images we synthesize retain\ninformation from the subject's MR scan, leading to higher resolution and the\nretention of anatomical features compared to the original set of PET images.\nWith simulated and real [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets, we show that pre-training a\npersonalized diffusion model with subject-specific \"pseudo-PET\" images improves\nreconstruction accuracy with low-count data. In particular, the method shows\npromise in combining information from a guidance MR scan without overly\nimposing anatomical features, demonstrating an improved trade-off between\nreconstructing PET-unique image features versus features present in both PET\nand MR. We believe this approach for generating and utilizing synthetic data\nhas further applications to medical imaging tasks, particularly because\npatient-specific PET images can be generated without resorting to generative\ndeep learning or large training datasets."}

While numerous CL methods aim to achieve this\ntrade-off, they often overlook the impact of network architecture on stability\nand plasticity, restricting the trade-off to the parameter level. In this\npaper, we delve into the conflict between stability and plasticity at the\narchitectural level.
