While deep\nlearning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet\ntagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer\n(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,\nremains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially\nunder realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a\nsystematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet\nclassification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel\njet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and\nreconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our\ncomprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably\nViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN\nbaselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of\ncapturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work\nestablishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for\napplying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using\npublic collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep\nlearning research in this domain."}

Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance.

This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for\nscanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel\nhyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around\nthe target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and\nrecognition.

Quantitative Structural\nModel (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree\nstructural reconstruction.

This study presents a novel unified framework that enables\nend-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative\ngraph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree\nsegmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through\ndedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology\nreasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf\nconditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and\ndata sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results\ndemonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in\nleaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with\npartial coverage (~30% relative error).

A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is\nintroduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to\nimproved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop\nclosure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition\nusing scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted\ninto a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.\nExtensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves\naccurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved\nrobustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity."}

The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained\nmodels, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2,\nEfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201.

The\nmaximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,\n13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score.

This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally\nefficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\ndatasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We\ndeveloped a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and\npreprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model\ngeneralization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset\nof 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based\nconvolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary\nattention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)\nblocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks.
