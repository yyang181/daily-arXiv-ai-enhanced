Accurate deformation modeling\nis essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment\nbetween preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the\nfinite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high\ncomputational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing\nalgorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced\nby pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical\ncorrespondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we\npropose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy\nwhile improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel\nhuman-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables\nsurgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,\nthereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt\ndynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available\ndataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration\nerror of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive\nframework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art\nmethods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our\nframework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while\nenhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more\nreliable computer-assisted surgeries."}

Event cameras efficiently measure\nbrightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed\nmotion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to\ncontinuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method\nconsists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact,\nand contours of ball and racket. Conventional computer vision techniques are\nutilized along with an original event-based processing to detect the timing at\nimpact (PATS: the amount of polarity asymmetry in time symmetry). The results\nof the experiments were within the permissible range for measuring tennis\nplayers' performance. Moreover, the computation time was sufficiently short for\nreal-time applications."}

AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\\%. Current\nclinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA\ndiameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet\nthese criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on\nthe maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the\ncomplex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized\nintervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve\nmonitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model\nto predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with\nlocal, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have\nparameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular\nsurface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using\na longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24\nAAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model\npredicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of\n1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a\npatient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93).\nFinally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set\nconsisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital.

This\nstrategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model\nto benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches\nare limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory\ndemands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in\n2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL\nframework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the\ncomputational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct\n3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the\nbackbone network.

These\ndiffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally\nlack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \\textit{Dispersive\nLoss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves\ndiffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal\nrepresentations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive\nself-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive\nsample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used\nfor regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment\n(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no\npre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate\nDispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report\nconsistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work\nwill help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation\nlearning."}

This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find\nthat even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can\neffectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and\nconsistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding\nbenchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying\ndata scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves\nLLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR."}

However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs\ndo not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model\n(LLM) backbones when curating the training data.

Its ability to safeguard privacy,\nat the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,\nseveral studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage\nattacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to\nreconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,\ncontends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the\neffectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as\nsmall batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.\n  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that\nclients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL\nenvironments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance\nfailures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To\nalleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,\nwhich introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient\nregularization.
