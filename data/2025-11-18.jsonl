Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-Weighted Feature Fusion Network (DWFF-Net). The encoder of this model utilizes a frozen-parameter DINOv3 to extract foundational features. By analyzing the relationships between different category images and feature maps, we introduce a data-level adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for feature fusion. The decoder incorporates a dynamic weight computation network to achieve thorough integration of multi-layer features, and a hybrid loss function is adopted to optimize model training. Experimental results on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.6979 and an F1-score of 0.8049, outperforming the baseline network by 0.021 and 0.0161, respectively. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary nature of multi-layer feature fusion, which effectively improves the IoU for micro-habitat categories such as field ridges.

Our key insight is that medical structures follow predictable geometric patterns that can guide prototype extraction even with limited training data. Unlike methods relying on complex architectural components or heavy neural networks, our approach leverages computationally lightweight geometric modeling. The framework combines three main components: (1) An edge-aware geodesic distance learning module that respects anatomical boundaries through iterative Fast Marching refinement, (2) adaptive prototype extraction that captures both global structure and local boundary details via spatially-weighted aggregation, and (3) adaptive parameter learning that automatically adjusts to different organ characteristics. Extensive experiments across diverse medical imaging datasets demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

To address these challenges, we propose AdaptFly, a prompt-guided test-time adaptation framework that adjusts segmentation models without weight updates. AdaptFly features two complementary adaptation modes. For resource-limited UAVs, it employs lightweight token-prompt retrieval from a shared global memory. For resource-massive UAVs, it uses gradient-free sparse visual prompt optimization via Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. An activation-statistic detector triggers adaptation, while cross-UAV knowledge pool consolidates prompt knowledge and enables fleet-wide collaboration with negligible bandwidth overhead. Extensive experiments on UAVid and VDD benchmarks, along with real-world UAV deployments under diverse weather conditions, demonstrate that AdaptFly significantly improves segmentation accuracy and robustness over static models and state-of-the-art TTA baselines.

Without prior knowledge, a word encountered for the first time can be interpreted in countless ways; it might refer to any of the objects in the environment, their components, or attributes. Using longitudinal, egocentric, and ecologically valid data from the experience of one child, in this work, we propose a self-supervised and biologically plausible strategy to learn strong visual representations. Our masked autoencoder-based visual backbone incorporates knowledge about the blind spot in human eyes to define a novel masking strategy. This mask and reconstruct approach attempts to mimic the way the human brain fills the gaps in the eyes' field of view. This represents a significant shift from standard random masking strategies, which are difficult to justify from a biological perspective. The pretrained encoder is utilized in a contrastive learning-based video-text model capable of acquiring word-referent mappings. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed biologically plausible masking strategy is at least as effective as random masking for learning word-referent mappings from cross-situational and temporally extended episodes."}

While spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics capture molecular features, they lack pathological morphological context. Integrating these omics with histopathological images is therefore essential for comprehensive disease tissue analysis. However, substantial heterogeneity across omics, imaging, and spatial modalities poses significant challenges. Naive fusion of semantically distinct sources often leads to ambiguous representations. Additionally, the resolution mismatch between high-resolution histology images and lower-resolution sequencing spots complicates spatial alignment. Biological perturbations during sample preparation further distort modality-specific signals, hindering accurate integration. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-guided Representation of Omics and Vision with Expert Regulation for Adaptive Spatial Multi-omics Fusion (GROVER), a novel framework for adaptive integration of spatial multi-omics data. GROVER leverages a Graph Convolutional Network encoder based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to capture the nonlinear dependencies between each modality and its associated spatial structure, thereby producing expressive, modality-specific embeddings. To align these representations, we introduce a spot-feature-pair contrastive learning strategy that explicitly optimizes the correspondence across modalities at each spot. Furthermore, we design a dynamic expert routing mechanism that adaptively selects informative modalities for each spot while suppressing noisy or low-quality inputs. Experiments on real-world spatial omics datasets demonstrate that GROVER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing a robust and reliable solution for multimodal integration."}

In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%."}

Dynamic graph learning (DGL) has been widely used to model dynamic systems, thanks to its ability to integrate spatio-temporal relationships. However, in MP, while existing DGL approaches can capture these dependencies, they fail to incorporate three-dimensional (3D) geometric information of parts and thus lack domain awareness in predicting machining operation sequences. To address this limitation, we propose MP-GFormer, a 3D-geometry-aware dynamic graph transformer that integrates evolving 3D geometric representations into DGL through an attention mechanism to predict machining operation sequences.

Traditional survey methods, including visual aerial counts and GNSS telemetry tracking, are widely used to monitor muskox populations in Arctic regions. These approaches are resource intensive and constrained by logistical challenges. Advances in remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and high resolution aerial imagery offer promising alternatives for wildlife detection. Yet, the effectiveness of deep learning object detection models (ODMs) is often limited by small datasets, making it challenging to train robust ODMs for sparsely distributed species like muskoxen. This study investigates the integration of synthetic imagery (SI) to supplement limited training data and improve muskox detection in zero shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) settings. We compared a baseline model trained on real imagery with 5 ZS and 5 FS models that incorporated progressively more SI in the training set. For the ZS models, where no real images were included in the training set, adding SI improved detection performance. As more SI were added, performance in precision, recall and F1 score increased, but eventually plateaued, suggesting diminishing returns when SI exceeded 100% of the baseline model training dataset. For FS models, combining real and SI led to better recall and slightly higher overall accuracy compared to using real images alone, though these improvements were not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SI to train accurate ODMs when data is scarce, offering important perspectives for wildlife monitoring by enabling rare or inaccessible species to be monitored and to increase monitoring frequency. This approach could be used to initiate ODMs without real data and refine it as real images are acquired over time."}

Prior efforts to improve performance include model finetuning, which requires large domain-specific datasets and significant compute, or manual prompt engineering, which is hard to generalize and often inaccessible to medical institutions seeking to deploy these tools. These challenges motivate interest in approaches that draw on a model's embedded knowledge while abstracting away dependence on human-designed prompts to enable scalable, weight-agnostic performance improvements. To explore this, we adapt the Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy) framework for structured automated prompt optimization in medical vision-language systems through a comprehensive, formal evaluation. We implement prompting pipelines for five medical imaging tasks across radiology, gastroenterology, and dermatology, evaluating 10 open-source VLMs with four prompt optimization techniques. Optimized pipelines achieved a median relative improvement of 53% over zero-shot prompting baselines, with the largest gains ranging from 300% to 3,400% on tasks where zero-shot performance is low. These results highlight the substantial potential of applying automated prompt optimization to medical AI systems, demonstrating significant gains for vision-based applications requiring accurate clinical image interpretation. By reducing dependence on prompt design to elicit intended outputs, these techniques allow clinicians to focus on patient care and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, our experiments offer scalability and preserve data privacy, demonstrating performance improvement on open-source VLMs. We publicly release our evaluation pipelines to support reproducible research on specialized medical tasks, available at https://github.com/DaneshjouLab/prompt-triage-lab."}

To solve this challenge, we present Query-aware Token Selector (\\textbf{QTSplus}), a lightweight yet powerful visual token selection module that serves as an information gate between the vision encoder and LLMs. Given a text query and video tokens, QTSplus dynamically selects the most important visual evidence for the input text query by (i) scoring visual tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \\emph{predicting} an instance-specific retention budget based on the complexity of the query, and (iii) \\emph{selecting} Top-$n$ tokens with a differentiable straight-through estimator during training and a hard gate at inference. Furthermore, a small re-encoder preserves temporal order using absolute time information, enabling second-level localization while maintaining global coverage.\n  Integrated into Qwen2.5-VL, QTSplus compresses the vision stream by up to \\textbf{89\\%} and reduces end-to-end latency by \\textbf{28\\%} on long videos.

However, they operate on RGB frames, which suffer from limited dynamic range. Therefore, dehazing remains ill-posed and can erase structure and illumination details. To address this, we use event cameras for dehazing for the \\textbf{first time}. Event cameras offer much higher HDR ($120 dBvs.60 dB$) and microsecond latency, therefore they suit hazy scenes. In practice, transferring HDR cues from events to frames is hard because real paired data are scarce. To tackle this, we propose an event-guided diffusion model that utilizes the strong generative priors of diffusion models to reconstruct clear images from hazy inputs by effectively transferring HDR information from events. Specifically, we design an event-guided module that maps sparse HDR event features, \\textit{e.g.,} edges, corners, into the diffusion latent space. This clear conditioning provides precise structural guidance during generation, improves visual realism, and reduces semantic drift.

Existing computational pathology approaches instead tend to evaluate coarse diseased classification under full supervision with image-only models, so it remains unclear how vision-language models (VLMs) should be adapted for clinically meaningful subtyping under data constraints. In this work, we model fine-grained glomerular subtyping as a clinically realistic few-shot problem and systematically evaluate both pathology-specialized and general-purpose vision-language models under this setting. We assess not only classification performance (accuracy, AUC, F1) but also the geometry of the learned representations, examining feature alignment between image and text embeddings and the separability of glomerular subtypes. By jointly analyzing shot count, model architecture and domain knowledge, and adaptation strategy, this study provides guidance for future model selection and training under real clinical data constraints. Our results indicate that pathology-specialized vision-language backbones, when paired with the vanilla fine-tuning, are the most effective starting point. Even with only 4-8 labeled examples per glomeruli subtype, these models begin to capture distinctions and show substantial gains in discrimination and calibration, though additional supervision continues to yield incremental improvements. We also find that the discrimination between positive and negative examples is as important as image-text alignment. Overall, our results show that supervision level and adaptation strategy jointly shape both diagnostic performance and multimodal structure, providing guidance for model selection, adaptation strategies, and annotation investment."}

To address these issues, this paper presents an IPPG method that breaks the constraint of facial close-ups, achieving synergistic optimization of identity fidelity and scene semantic creation. Specifically, we design a Dual-Line Inference (DLI) pipeline with identity-semantic separation, resolving the representation conflict between ID and semantics inherent in traditional single-path architectures. Further, we propose an Identity Adaptive Fusion (IdAF) strategy that defers ID-semantic fusion to the noise prediction stage, integrating adaptive attention fusion and noise decision masking to avoid ID embedding interference on semantics without manual masking. Finally, an Identity Aggregation Prepending (IdAP) module is introduced to aggregate ID information and replace random initializations, further enhancing identity preservation. Experimental results validate that our method achieves stable and effective performance in IPPG tasks beyond facial close-ups, enabling efficient generation without manual masking or fine-tuning. As a plug-and-play component, it can be rapidly deployed in existing IPPG frameworks, addressing the over-reliance on facial close-ups, facilitating film-level character-scene creation, and providing richer personalized generation capabilities for related domains."}

Among them, transformation-based attacks have demonstrated notable success in transfer attacks. However, existing attacks suffer from blind spots in parameter optimization, limiting their full potential. Specifically, (1) prior work generally considers low-iteration settings, yet attacks perform quite differently at higher iterations, so characterizing overall performance based only on low-iteration results is misleading. (2) Existing attacks use uniform parameters for different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks, which greatly impairs transferability. (3) Traditional transformation parameter optimization relies on grid search. For n parameters with m steps each, the complexity is O(mn). Large computational overhead limits further optimization of parameters. To address these limitations, we conduct an empirical study with various transformations as baselines, revealing three dynamic patterns of transferability with respect to parameter strength. We further propose a novel Concentric Decay Model (CDM) to effectively explain these patterns. Building on these insights, we propose an efficient Dynamic Parameter Optimization (DPO) based on the rise-then-fall pattern, reducing the complexity to O(nlogm). Comprehensive experiments on existing transformation-based attacks across different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks demonstrate that our DPO can significantly improve transferability."}

In the subsequent fine stage, we recast 2D segmentation as 1D regression problem by sampling groove-normal profiles using the coarse mask and performing point-wise refinement with a lightweight MLP.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Weakly-Supervised Generalized Referring Expression Comprehension task (WGREC), a more practical paradigm that handles expressions with variable numbers of referents. However, extending WREC to WGREC presents two fundamental challenges: supervisory signal ambiguity, where weak image-level supervision is insufficient for training a model to infer the correct number and identity of referents, and semantic representation collapse, where standard Euclidean similarity forces hierarchically-related concepts into non-discriminative clusters, blurring categorical boundaries. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel WGREC framework named Linguistic Instance-Split Hyperbolic-Euclidean (LIHE), which operates in two stages. The first stage, Referential Decoupling, predicts the number of target objects and decomposes the complex expression into simpler sub-expressions. The second stage, Referent Grounding, then localizes these sub-expressions using HEMix, our innovative hybrid similarity module that synergistically combines the precise alignment capabilities of Euclidean proximity with the hierarchical modeling strengths of hyperbolic geometry. This hybrid approach effectively prevents semantic collapse while preserving fine-grained distinctions between related concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate LIHE establishes the first effective weakly supervised WGREC baseline on gRefCOCO and Ref-ZOM, while HEMix achieves consistent improvements on standard REC benchmarks, improving IoU@0.5 by up to 2.5\\%.

We observe that methods which separate range-space enforcement from null-space diffusion-prior updates yield stable, realistic reconstructions. Building on this, we introduce Null-Space Diffusion Distillation (NSDD): a single-pass student that distills the null-space component of an iterative DDNM+ solver, conditioned on the lensless measurement and on a range-space anchor. NSDD preserves measurement consistency and achieves photorealistic results without paired supervision at a fraction of the runtime and memory.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that jointly integrates visual and physical cues for hand-object pose estimation. This integration is achieved through two key ideas: 1) joint visual-physical cue learning: The model is trained to extract 2D visual cues and 3D physical cues, thereby enabling more comprehensive representation learning for hand-object interactions; 2) candidate pose aggregation: A novel refinement process that aggregates multiple diffusion-generated candidate poses by leveraging both visual and physical predictions, yielding a final estimate that is visually consistent and physically plausible.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Knowledge-Augmented Masked Image Generation framework, named KA-MIG, which introduces explicit knowledge of token-level semantic dependencies (\\emph{i.e.}, extracted from the training data) as priors to learn richer representations for improving performance. In particular, we explore and identify three types of advantageous token knowledge graphs, including two positive and one negative graphs (\\emph{i.e.}, the co-occurrence graph, the semantic similarity graph, and the position-token incompatibility graph). Based on three prior knowledge graphs, we design a graph-aware encoder to learn token and position-aware representations.

We provide theoretical insights into this issue from an anchor shift perspective. Observed modalities are aligned with a local anchor that deviates from the optimal one when all modalities are present, resulting in an inevitable shift. To address this, we propose CalMRL for multimodal representation learning to calibrate incomplete alignments caused by missing modalities. Specifically, CalMRL leverages the priors and the inherent connections among modalities to model the imputation for the missing ones at the representation level. To resolve the optimization dilemma, we employ a bi-step learning method with the closed-form solution of the posterior distribution of shared latents. We validate its mitigation of anchor shift and convergence with theoretical guidance. By equipping the calibrated alignment with the existing advanced method, we offer new flexibility to absorb data with missing modalities, which is originally unattainable. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses demonstrate the superiority of CalMRL. Our code, model checkpoints, and evaluation raw data will be publicly available."}

Project Page: https://xinyuanhu66.github.io/SRSplat/", "summary": "Feed-forward 3D reconstruction from sparse, low-resolution (LR) images is a crucial capability for real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and embodied AI. However, existing methods often fail to recover fine texture details. This limitation stems from the inherent lack of high-frequency information in LR inputs. To address this, we propose \\textbf{SRSplat}, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs high-resolution 3D scenes from only a few LR views. Our main insight is to compensate for the deficiency of texture information by jointly leveraging external high-quality reference images and internal texture cues. We first construct a scene-specific reference gallery, generated for each scene using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and diffusion models. To integrate this external information, we introduce the \\textit{Reference-Guided Feature Enhancement (RGFE)} module, which aligns and fuses features from the LR input images and their reference twin image. Subsequently, we train a decoder to predict the Gaussian primitives using the multi-view fused feature obtained from \\textit{RGFE}. To further refine predicted Gaussian primitives, we introduce \\textit{Texture-Aware Density Control (TADC)}, which adaptively adjusts Gaussian density based on the internal texture richness of the LR inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SRSplat outperforms existing methods on various datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU, and exhibits strong cross-dataset and cross-resolution generalization capabilities."}

Despite recent advances, non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data poses an inevitable challenge that hinders the use of FL. In this work, we address the issue of non-IID histopathological images with feature distribution shifts from an intuitive perspective that has only received limited attention. Specifically, we address this issue from the perspective of data distribution by solely adjusting the data distributions of all clients. Building on the success of diffusion models in fitting data distributions and leveraging stain separation to extract the pivotal features that are closely related to the non-IID properties of histopathological images, we propose a Federated Stain Distribution Alignment (FedSDA) method. FedSDA aligns the stain distribution of each client with a target distribution in an FL framework to mitigate distribution shifts among clients. Furthermore, considering that training diffusion models on raw data in FL has been shown to be susceptible to privacy leakage risks, we circumvent this problem while still effectively achieving alignment. Extensive experimental results show that FedSDA is not only effective in improving baselines that focus on mitigating disparities across clients' model updates but also outperforms baselines that address the non-IID data issues from the perspective of data distribution. We show that FedSDA provides valuable and practical insights for the computational pathology community."}

First, we design a pipelining algorithm (PipeSP) for sequence parallelism (SP) to enable the computation of latent generation and commu- nication among multiple GPUs to be pipelined, thus reduc- ing inference latency. Second, we propose DeDiVAE to de- couple the diffusion module and the variational autoencoder (VAE) module into two GPU groups, whose executions can also be pipelined to reduce memory consumption and infer- ence latency.

To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%."}

Inspired by the physical root of the problem, the spatial misalignment of RGB color channels due to lens dispersion, we introduce a novel Chromatic-Aware Coordinate Transformation (CA-CT) module, learning an image-adaptive color space to decouple and isolate fringing into a dedicated dimension. This targeted separation allows the network to learn a precise ``purple fringe channel\", which then guides the accurate restoration of the luminance channel. The final color correction is performed by a learned 5D Look-Up Table (5D LUT), enabling efficient and powerful% non-linear color mapping.

We present Vision Anchored Audio-Visual Emotion LLM (VAEmotionLLM), a two-stage framework that teaches a VLM to hear by seeing with limited audio pretraining and to understand emotion across modalities. In Stage 1, Vision-Guided Audio Alignment (VG-Align) distills the frozen visual pathway into a new audio pathway by aligning next-token distributions of the shared LLM on synchronized audio-video clips, enabling hearing without a large audio dataset. In Stage 2, a lightweight Cross-Modal Emotion Adapter (EmoAdapter), composed of the Emotion Enhancer and the Emotion Supervisor, injects emotion-sensitive residuals and applies emotion supervision to enhance cross-modal emotion understanding. We also construct ArtEmoBenchmark, an art-centric emotion benchmark that evaluates content and emotion understanding under audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual inputs.

However, its effectiveness hinges on robust codebook design. Current prototype-based approaches relying on trainable vectors or clustered centroids fall short in representativeness and interpretability, even as multimodal alignment demonstrates its promise in vision-language models. To address these limitations, we propose a simple multimodal prompting-driven quantization framework for point cloud analysis. Our methodology is built upon two core insights: 1) Text embeddings from pre-trained models inherently encode visual semantics through many-to-one contrastive alignment, naturally serving as robust prototype priors; and 2) Multimodal prompts enable adaptive refinement of these prototypes, effectively mitigating vision-language semantic gaps. The framework introduces a dual-constrained quantization space, enforced by compactness and separation regularization, which seamlessly integrates visual and prototype features, resulting in hybrid representations that jointly encode geometric and semantic information. Furthermore, we employ Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to achieve differentiable discretization while maintaining quantization sparsity. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets clearly demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed method."}

It enables efficient adaptation to new tasks while mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. These methods typically attach one independent task-specific prompt to each layer of pre-trained models to locally modulate its features, ensuring that the layer's representation aligns with the requirements of the new task. However, although introducing learnable prompts independently at each layer provides high flexibility for adapting to new tasks, this overly flexible tuning could make certain layers susceptible to unnecessary updates. As all prompts till the current task are added together as a final prompt for all seen tasks, the model may easily overwrite feature representations essential to previous tasks, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose a novel hierarchical layer-grouped prompt tuning method for continual learning. It improves model stability in two ways: (i) Layers in the same group share roughly the same prompts, which are adjusted by position encoding. This helps preserve the intrinsic feature relationships and propagation pathways of the pre-trained model within each group. (ii) It utilizes a single task-specific root prompt to learn to generate sub-prompts for each layer group. In this way, all sub-prompts are conditioned on the same root prompt, enhancing their synergy and reducing independence.

To extend these successes to generate coherent long videos, most video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent frames conditioned on previous ones. There are generally two primary paradigms: chunk-based extension and stream denoising. The former directly concatenates previous clean frames as conditioning, suffering from denoising latency and error accumulation. The latter maintains the denoising sequence with monotonically increasing noise levels. In each denoising iteration, one clean frame is produced while a new pure noise is simultaneously appended, enabling live-stream sampling. However, it struggles with fragile consistency and poor motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Begin-of-Video Tokens (ada-BOV) for autoregressive VDMs. The BOV tokens are special learnable embeddings on VDMs. They adaptively absorb denoised preceding frames via an adaptive-layer-norm-like modulation. This design preserves the global consistency while allowing for flexible conditioning in dynamic scenarios. To ensure the quality of local dynamics essential in modulating BOV tokens, we further propose a refinement strategy for stream denoising. It decouples the sampling trajectory length from the attention window size constraint, leading to improved local guidance and overall imaging quality. We also propose a disturbance-augmented training noise schedule, which balances the convergence speed with model robustness for the stream denoising.

Attribution methods can accurately identify a model's critical regions. However, masking these areas to create counterfactuals often causes the model to misclassify the target, while humans can still easily recognize it. This divergence highlights that the model's learned dependencies may not be sufficiently causal. To address this issue, we propose Subset-Selected Counterfactual Augmentation (SS-CA), which integrates counterfactual explanations directly into the training process for targeted intervention. Building on the subset-selection-based LIMA attribution method, we develop Counterfactual LIMA to identify minimal spatial region sets whose removal can selectively alter model predictions. Leveraging these attributions, we introduce a data augmentation strategy that replaces the identified regions with natural background, and we train the model jointly on both augmented and original samples to mitigate incomplete causal learning. Extensive experiments across multiple ImageNet variants show that SS-CA improves generalization on in-distribution (ID) test data and achieves superior performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks such as ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S. Under perturbations including noise, models trained with SS-CA also exhibit enhanced generalization, demonstrating that our approach effectively uses interpretability insights to correct model deficiencies and improve both performance and robustness."}

To address these issues, we propose Object Attribute Description Promoter (OAD-Promoter), a novel approach for enhancing LLM-based VQA by mitigating language bias and improving domain-shift robustness.

TSM exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time steps to produce a smooth curriculum within each sequence, which reduces gradient variance and stabilizes optimization with theoretical analysis. To employ auxiliary supervision from TSM, TMKT introduces two lightweight modality-aware objectives, Modality Aware Guidance (MAG) for per-frame source supervision and Mixup Ratio Perception (MRP) for sequence-level mix ratio estimation, which explicitly align temporal features with the mixing schedule. TMKT enables smoother knowledge transfer, helps mitigate modality mismatch during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.

In this paper, we present FIA-Edit, a novel inversion-free framework that achieves high-fidelity and semantically precise edits through a Frequency-Interactive Attention. Specifically, we design two key components: (1) a Frequency Representation Interaction (FRI) module that enhances cross-domain alignment by exchanging frequency components between source and target features within self-attention, and (2) a Feature Injection (FIJ) module that explicitly incorporates source-side queries, keys, values, and text embeddings into the target branch's cross-attention to preserve structure and semantics. Comprehensive and extensive experiments demonstrate that FIA-Edit supports high-fidelity editing at low computational cost (~6s per 512 * 512 image on an RTX 4090) and consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse tasks in visual quality, background fidelity, and controllability.

We empirically show that this paradigm often results in structural inconsistencies and topological artifacts due to limited geometric and semantic constraints. To address this, we rethink the task and propose a more robust paradigm, termed Completion-by-Correction, which begins with a topologically complete shape prior generated by a pretrained image-to-3D model and performs feature-space correction to align it with the partial observation. This paradigm shifts completion from unconstrained synthesis to guided refinement, enabling structurally consistent and observation-aligned reconstruction. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce PGNet, a multi-stage framework that conducts dual-feature encoding to ground the generative prior, synthesizes a coarse yet structurally aligned scaffold, and progressively refines geometric details via hierarchical correction.

Yet, unlike discrete tokens constrained by a fixed codebook, continuous representations lie in a vast and unstructured space, posing significant challenges for efficient autoregressive modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce MixAR, a novel framework that leverages mixture training paradigms to inject discrete tokens as prior guidance for continuous AR modeling. MixAR is a factorized formulation that leverages discrete tokens as prior guidance for continuous autoregressive prediction. We investigate several discrete-continuous mixture strategies, including self-attention (DC-SA), cross-attention (DC-CA), and a simple approach (DC-Mix) that replaces homogeneous mask tokens with informative discrete counterparts. Moreover, to bridge the gap between ground-truth training tokens and inference tokens produced by the pre-trained AR model, we propose Training-Inference Mixture (TI-Mix) to achieve consistent training and generation distributions.

Existing methods typically address either cross-view generalization or unsupervised domain adaptation in isolation, leaving a gap in the robust and scalable deployment of models across diverse vehicle configurations. In this work, we propose a novel two-phase cross-view, cross-modal unsupervised domain adaptation framework that addresses these challenges jointly on real-time driver monitoring data. In the first phase, we learn view-invariant and action-discriminative features within a single modality using contrastive learning on multi-view data. In the second phase, we perform domain adaptation to a new modality using information bottleneck loss without requiring any labeled data from the new domain.

In this paper, we introduce OmniSparse, a training-aware fine-grained sparse attention framework for long-video MLLMs, which operates in both training and inference with dynamic token budget allocation. Specifically, OmniSparse contains three adaptive and complementary mechanisms: (1) query selection via lazy-active classification, retaining active queries that capture broad semantic similarity while discarding most lazy ones that focus on limited local context and exhibit high functional redundancy; (2) KV selection with head-level dynamic budget allocation, where a shared budget is determined based on the flattest head and applied uniformly across all heads to ensure attention recall; and (3) KV cache slimming to reduce head-level redundancy by selectively fetching visual KV cache according to the head-level decoding query pattern.

Specifically, we design a multi-view geometry information extraction module that leverages depth maps, normal maps, and foreground segmentation masks to construct a shared geometric structure, ensuring shape and structural consistency across different views. To enhance consistency and detail restoration during generation, we develop a decoupled geometry-enhanced attention mechanism that strengthens feature focus on key geometric details, thereby improving overall image quality and detail preservation. Furthermore, we apply an adaptive learning strategy that fine-tunes the model to better capture spatial relationships and visual coherence between the generated views, ensuring realistic results. Our model also incorporates an iterative refinement process that progressively improves the output quality through multiple stages of image generation.

Based on evaluation results, the model achieves an overall precision of 0.9147, a recall of 0.886, and a mean Average Precision (mAP@50) of 0.843. The mAP@50 95 of 0.503 further indicates strong detection capability under stricter IoU thresholds.

The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems."}

Recent benchmarks evaluate MLLMs' capabilities on multi-view videos that capture different perspectives of the same scene. However, their limited tasks hinder a thorough assessment of MLLMs in diverse real-world CVR scenarios. To this end, we introduce CrossVid, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning ability in cross-video contexts.

To address this challenge, we propose D$^{3}$ToM, a Decider-guided dynamic token merging method that dynamically merges redundant visual tokens at different denoising steps to accelerate inference in Diffusion MLLMs. At each denoising step, D$^{3}$ToM uses decider tokens-the tokens generated in the previous denoising step-to build an importance map over all visual tokens.

This plug-and-play module integrates into a single transformer layer, physically shortening the visual token sequence for all subsequent layers without altering model parameters. Moreover, D$^{3}$ToM employs a merge ratio that dynamically varies with each denoising step, aligns with the native decoding process of Diffusion MLLMs, achieving superior performance under equivalent computational budgets. Extensive experiments show that D$^{3}$ToM accelerates inference while preserving competitive performance. The code is released at https://github.com/bcmi/D3ToM-Diffusion-MLLM."}

This paper identifies the frequency misalignment between real and synthesized images as one of the key factors underlying unreliable GDA and proposes the Frequency Recalibration (FreRec) method to reduce the frequency distributional discrepancy and thus improve GDA. FreRec involves (1) Statistical High-frequency Replacement (SHR) to roughly align high-frequency components and (2) Reconstructive High-frequency Mapping (RHM) to enhance image quality and reconstruct high-frequency details.

At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection.

However, existing methods for reasoning segmentation require multimodal large language models with billions of parameters that exceed the computational capabilities of edge devices that typically deploy the embodied AI systems. Distillation offers a pathway to compress these models while preserving their capabilities. Yet, existing distillation approaches fail to transfer the multi-step reasoning capabilities that reasoning segmentation demands, as they focus on matching output predictions and intermediate features rather than preserving reasoning chains. The emerging paradigm of reasoning over digital twin representations presents an opportunity for more effective distillation by re-framing the problem. Consequently, we propose FastReasonSeg, which employs digital twin representations that decouple perception from reasoning to enable more effective distillation. Our distillation scheme first relies on supervised fine-tuning on teacher-generated reasoning chains. Then it is followed by reinforcement fine-tuning with joint rewards evaluating both segmentation accuracy and reasoning quality alignment. Experiments on two video (JiTBench, RVTBench) and two image benchmarks (ReasonSeg, LLM-Seg40K) demonstrate that our FastReasonSeg achieves state-of-the-art reasoning segmentation performance. Moreover, the distilled 0.6B variant outperforms models with 20 times more parameters while achieving 7.79 FPS throughput with only 2.1GB memory consumption. This efficiency enables deployment in resource-constrained environments to enable real-time reasoning segmentation."}

Existing methods have progressed to handling explicit queries where the visual content of interest is described explicitly; however, they fail with implicit queries where identifying videos relevant to the query requires reasoning. We introduce reasoning text-to-video retrieval, a paradigm that extends traditional retrieval to process implicit queries through reasoning while providing object-level grounding masks that identify which entities satisfy the query conditions. Instead of relying on vision-language models directly, we propose representing video content as digital twins, i.e., structured scene representations that decompose salient objects through specialist vision models. This approach is beneficial because it enables large language models to reason directly over long-horizon video content without visual token compression. Specifically, our two-stage framework first performs compositional alignment between decomposed sub-queries and digital twin representations for candidate identification, then applies large language model-based reasoning with just-in-time refinement that invokes additional specialist models to address information gaps. We construct a benchmark of 447 manually created implicit queries with 135 videos (ReasonT2VBench-135) and another more challenging version of 1000 videos (ReasonT2VBench-1000). Our method achieves 81.2% R@1 on ReasonT2VBench-135, outperforming the strongest baseline by greater than 50 percentage points, and maintains 81.7% R@1 on the extended configuration while establishing state-of-the-art results in three conventional benchmarks (MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX)."}

Aleatoric uncertainty is estimated using a regularized global density model, while epistemic uncertainty is formed from three complementary components that capture local support deficiency, manifold spectral collapse, and cross-layer feature inconsistency. These components are empirically orthogonal and require no sampling, no ensembling, and no additional forward passes. We integrate the decomposed uncertainty into a distribution free conformal calibration procedure that yields significantly tighter prediction intervals at matched coverage. Using these components for uncertainty guided adaptive model selection reduces compute by approximately 60 percent on MOT17 with negligible accuracy loss, enabling practical self regulating visual inference.

Continuing the pose-only perspective, this paper explores the critical relationship between the scene structures, rotation and translation. Notably, the translation can be expressed in terms of rotation, allowing us to condense the imaging geometry representation onto the rotation manifold. A rotation-only optimization framework based on reprojection error is proposed for both two-view and multi-view scenarios.

ResNet can be viewed as a discretized form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). From this perspective, the multiple residual blocks within a single ResNet stage essentially perform multi-step discrete iterations of the feature transformation for that stage. The recently proposed flow matching model, MeanFlow, enables one-step generative modeling by learning the mean velocity field to transform distributions. Inspired by this, we propose MeanFlow-Incubated ResNet (MFI-ResNet), which employs a compression-expansion strategy to jointly improve parameter efficiency and discriminative performance. In the compression phase, we simplify the multi-layer structure within each ResNet stage to one or two MeanFlow modules to construct a lightweight meta model. In the expansion phase, we apply a selective incubation strategy to the first three stages, expanding them to match the residual block configuration of the baseline ResNet model, while keeping the last stage in MeanFlow form, and fine-tune the incubated model. Experimental results show that on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, MFI-ResNet achieves remarkable parameter efficiency, reducing parameters by 46.28% and 45.59% compared to ResNet-50, while still improving accuracy by 0.23% and 0.17%, respectively.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified multi-modality image fusion framework based on channel perturbation and pre-trained knowledge integration (UP-Fusion).

Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks. If the driver is identified as drowsy, the system issues a continuous alert in real time, embedded in the Smart Car technology.By potentially saving innocent lives on the roadways, the proposed technique offers a non-invasive, inexpensive, and cost-effective way to identify drowsiness.

Dense annotations are more valuable but remain scarce. Traditional text-based annotation pipelines are poorly suited for creating dense annotations: typing limits expressiveness, slows annotation speed, and underrepresents nuanced visual features, especially in specialized areas such as multicultural imagery and 3D asset annotation. In this paper, we present DenseAnnotate, an audio-driven online annotation platform that enables efficient creation of dense, fine-grained annotations for images and 3D assets. Annotators narrate observations aloud while synchronously linking spoken phrases to image regions or 3D scene parts.

This highlights the potential of masked regions as sources of semantic diversity. Motivated by this, we revisit the image masking approach, proposing to treat masked content as auxiliary knowledge rather than ignored. Based on this, we propose MaskAnyNet, which combines masking with a relearning mechanism to exploit both visible and masked information. It can be easily extended to any model with an additional branch to jointly learn from the recomposed masked region.

However, while these approaches primarily focus on enhancing in-frame regions, they often struggle to reconstruct critical out-of-frame areas near the sides of the ego-vehicle, although previous frames commonly contain valuable contextual information about these unseen regions. To address this limitation, we propose the Current-Centric Contextual 3D Fusion (C3DFusion) module, which generates hidden region-aware 3D feature geometry by explicitly aligning 3D-lifted point features from both current and historical frames. C3DFusion performs enhanced temporal fusion through two complementary techniques-historical context blurring and current-centric feature densification-which suppress noise from inaccurately warped historical point features by attenuating their scale, and enhance current point features by increasing their volumetric contribution. Simply integrated into standard SSC architectures, C3DFusion demonstrates strong effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Furthermore, it exhibits robust generalization, achieving notable performance gains when applied to other baseline models."}

We address this limitation with a blur-robust AIGI detection framework based on teacher-student knowledge distillation. A high-capacity teacher (DINOv3), trained on clean (i.e., sharp) images, provides stable and semantically rich representations that serve as a reference for learning. By freezing the teacher to maintain its generalization ability, we distill its feature and logit responses from sharp images to a student trained on blurred counterparts, enabling the student to produce consistent representations under motion degradation.

Guided by the semantic prior, we propose degradation-aware channel attention module (DCAM), which employ degradation prototype decomposition to facilitate multi-modal feature interaction in channel domain. In addition, to achieve effective expert routing, the semantic prior and channel-domain modulated features are utilized to guide the MoE, enabling robust image fusion in complex degradation scenarios.

To address this, we propose Hierarchically Guided Fine-grained Augmentation (HiGFA). HiGFA leverages the temporal dynamics of the diffusion sampling process. It employs strong text and transformed contour guidance with fixed strengths in the early-to-mid sampling stages to establish overall scene, style, and structure. In the final sampling stages, HiGFA activates a specialized fine-grained classifier guidance and dynamically modulates the strength of all guidance signals based on prediction confidence. This hierarchical, confidence-driven orchestration enables HiGFA to generate diverse yet faithful synthetic images by intelligently balancing global structure formation with precise detail refinement. Experiments on several FGVC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGFA."}

Our goal is to enable fully automated aerial wildfire monitoring using autonomous drones, allowing for the early detection of ground fires before smoke or flames are visible. While synthetic aperture (SA) sensing mitigates occlusion from the canopy and sunlight, it introduces thermal blur that obscures the actual surface temperatures. To address this, we train a visual state space model to recover the subtle thermal signals of partially occluded soil and fire hotspots from this blurred data. A key challenge was the scarcity of real-world training data. We overcome this by integrating a latent diffusion model into a vector quantized to generated a large volume of realistic surface temperature simulations from real wildfire recordings, which we further expanded through temperature augmentation and procedural thermal forest simulation. On simulated data across varied ambient and surface temperatures, forest densities, and sunlight conditions, our method reduced the RMSE by a factor of 2 to 2.5 compared to conventional thermal and uncorrected SA imaging. In field experiments focused on high-temperature hotspots, the improvement was even more significant, with a 12.8-fold RMSE gain over conventional thermal and a 2.6-fold gain over uncorrected SA images. We also demonstrate our model's generalization to other thermal signals, such as human signatures for search and rescue. Since simple thresholding is frequently inadequate for detecting subtle thermal signals, the morphological characteristics are equally essential for accurate classification. Our experiments demonstrated another clear advantage: we reconstructed the complete morphology of fire and human signatures, whereas conventional imaging is defeated by partial occlusion."}

To overcome this limitation, we identify typographical attacks as a promising direction for protecting geo-privacy by adding text extension outside the visual content. We further investigate which textual semantics are effective in disrupting geolocation inference and design a two-stage, semantics-aware typographical attack that generates deceptive text to protect user privacy. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces geolocation prediction accuracy of five state-of-the-art commercial LVLMs, establishing a practical and visually-preserving protection strategy against emerging geo-privacy threats."}

Regression-based counting methods offer advantages over detection-based ones in handling overlapped cells, yet rarely support end-to-end multi-class counting. Moreover, the potential of foundation models remains largely underexplored in this paradigm. To address these limitations, we propose a rank-aware agglomeration framework that selectively distills knowledge from multiple strong foundation models, leveraging their complementary representations to handle IHC heterogeneity and obtain a compact yet effective student model, CountIHC. Unlike prior task-agnostic agglomeration strategies that either treat all teachers equally or rely on feature similarity, we design a Rank-Aware Teacher Selecting (RATS) strategy that models global-to-local patch rankings to assess each teacher's inherent counting capacity and enable sample-wise teacher selection. For multi-class cell counting, we introduce a fine-tuning stage that reformulates the task as vision-language alignment. Discrete semantic anchors derived from structured text prompts encode both category and quantity information, guiding the regression of class-specific density maps and improving counting for overlapping cells. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CountIHC surpasses state-of-the-art methods across 12 IHC biomarkers and 5 tissue types, while exhibiting high agreement with pathologists' assessments. Its effectiveness on H&E-stained data further confirms the scalability of the proposed method."}

It then samples reference points in RoI regions of the mask and applies cross-attention with BEV features to refine the query representations of each lane.RBTR models lane connectivity based on boundary-point query features and further employs a topological denoising strategy to reduce matching ambiguity.By integrating spatial and sequential priors into fine-grained queries and applying a denoising strategy to boundary-point topology reasoning, our method precisely models complex lane structures and delivers trustworthy topology predictions.Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that TopoFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with an OLS of 48.0% on subsetA and 45.4% on subsetB."}

This is achieved by replacing the discriminative learning with the latent learning process. Specifically, our method incorporates three core components: (1) an image encoder generating latent priors from input images, (2) a spatial-aware seglat (a latent expression of segmentation mask) encoder that maps segmentation masks into discrete latent tokens using a location-sensitive color mapping to distinguish instances, and (3) a decoder reconstructing masks from these latents. A multi-stage training strategy is introduced: first learning seglat representations via image-seglat joint training, then refining latent transformations, and finally aligning image-encoder-derived latents with seglat distributions. Experiments show Seg-VAR outperforms previous discriminative and generative methods on various segmentation tasks and validation benchmarks. By framing segmentation as a sequential hierarchical prediction task, Seg-VAR opens new avenues for integrating autoregressive reasoning into spatial-aware vision systems.

Understanding whether pixel (video) or position (tracking) modalities leads to better group activity recognition is therefore important to drive further research on the topic.

Many existing TTA methods suffer substantial performance drops under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Ladder Network that extracts OOD features from class tokens aggregated across all Transformer layers. OOD detection performance is enhanced by combining the original model prediction with the output of the Hierarchical Ladder Network (HLN) via weighted probability fusion. To improve robustness under domain shift, we further introduce an Attention Affine Network (AAN) that adaptively refines the self-attention mechanism conditioned on the token information to better adapt to domain drift, thereby improving the classification performance of the model on datasets with domain shift.

To address this challenge, we introduce MDiTFace--a customized diffusion transformer framework that employs a unified tokenization strategy to process semantic mask and text inputs, eliminating discrepancies between heterogeneous modality representations. The framework facilitates comprehensive multimodal feature interaction through stacked, newly designed multivariate transformer blocks that process all conditions synchronously. Additionally, we design a novel decoupled attention mechanism by dissociating implicit dependencies between mask tokens and temporal embeddings. This mechanism segregates internal computations into dynamic and static pathways, enabling caching and reuse of features computed in static pathways after initial calculation, thereby reducing additional computational overhead introduced by mask condition by over 94% while maintaining performance.

Recent methods attempt to address this dilemma by regularizing high-dimensional latent spaces using external vision foundation models (VFMs). However, it remains unclear how high-dimensional VAE latents affect the optimization of generative models. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to reveal that redundant high-frequency components in high-dimensional latent spaces hinder the training convergence of diffusion models and, consequently, degrade generation quality. To alleviate this problem, we propose a spectral self-regularization strategy to suppress redundant high-frequency noise while simultaneously preserving reconstruction quality. The resulting Denoising-VAE, a ViT-based autoencoder that does not rely on VFMs, produces cleaner, lower-noise latents, leading to improved generative quality and faster optimization convergence. We further introduce a spectral alignment strategy to facilitate the optimization of Denoising-VAE-based generative models.

Nevertheless, the challenge is that existing prompt tuning methods cannot precisely distinguish different kinds of medical concepts, which miss essentially specific disease-related features across various medical imaging modalities in medical image classification tasks. We find that Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive text corpora, are particularly adept at providing this specialized medical knowledge.

CILMP extracts disease-specific representations from LLMs, intervenes within a low-rank linear subspace, and utilizes them to create disease-specific prompts. Additionally, a conditional mechanism is incorporated to condition the intervention process on each individual medical image, generating instance-adaptive prompts and thus enhancing adaptability.

To tackle this issue, we propose Fourier Series-based Tampering Synthesis (FSTS), a structured and interpretable framework for synthesizing tampered text images. FSTS first collects 16,750 real-world tampering instances from five representative tampering types, using a structured pipeline that records human-performed editing traces via multi-format logs (e.g., video, PSD, and editing logs). By analyzing these collected parameters and identifying recurring behavioral patterns at both individual and population levels, we formulate a hierarchical modeling framework. Specifically, each individual tampering parameter is represented as a compact combination of basis operation-parameter configurations, while the population-level distribution is constructed by aggregating these behaviors. Since this formulation draws inspiration from the Fourier series, it enables an interpretable approximation using basis functions and their learned weights. By sampling from this modeled distribution, FSTS synthesizes diverse and realistic training data that better reflect real-world forgery traces.

While recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based approaches, have significantly improved NVS quality, existing evaluation metrics struggle to assess whether a generated image is both realistic and faithful to the source view and intended viewpoint transformation. Standard metrics, such as pixel-wise similarity and distribution-based measures, often mis-rank incorrect results as they fail to capture the nuanced relationship between the source image, viewpoint change, and generated output. We propose a task-aware evaluation framework that leverages features from a strong NVS foundation model, Zero123, combined with a lightweight tuning step to enhance discrimination.

Both reliably identify incorrect generations and rank models in agreement with human preference studies, addressing a fundamental gap in NVS evaluation. Our framework provides a principled and practical approach to assessing synthesis quality, paving the way for more reliable progress in novel view synthesis.

Hallucination detectability is highest for unified-fusion models with dense visual tokenization (Qwen2.5-VL) and lowest for architectures with restricted tokenization (Med-Gemma). Embedding-based clustering often yields stronger separation when applied directly to the generated answers, whereas NLI-based clustering remains advantageous for LLaVA-Med and for longer, sentence-level responses. Across configurations, the VASE metric consistently provides the most robust hallucination signal, especially when paired with embedding clustering and a moderate sampling budget (n ~ 10-15). Prompt design also matters: concise, label-style outputs offer clearer semantic structure than syntactically constrained one-sentence responses.\n  By framing hallucination detection as a geometric robustness problem shaped jointly by sampling scale, prompt structure, model architecture, and clustering strategy, HEDGE provides a principled, compute-aware foundation for evaluating multimodal reliability.

To address this gap, we introduce a controllability-based interpretability framework that quantifies how different parts of the input sequence (tokens or patches) influence the internal state dynamics of SSMs. We propose two complementary formulations: a Jacobian-based method applicable to any SSM architecture that measures influence through the full chain of state propagation, and a Gramian-based approach for diagonal SSMs that achieves superior speed through closed-form analytical solutions. Both methods operate in a single forward pass with linear complexity, requiring no architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. We validate our framework through experiments on three diverse medical imaging modalities, demonstrating that SSMs naturally implement hierarchical feature refinement from diffuse low-level textures in early layers to focused, clinically meaningful patterns in deeper layers. Our analysis reveals domain-specific controllability signatures aligned with diagnostic criteria, progressive spatial selectivity across the network hierarchy, and the substantial influence of scanning strategies on attention patterns. Beyond medical imaging, we articulate applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-domain tasks.

This failure stems from a fundamental architectural limitation where backbone networks encode occluding surfaces rather than target objects, thereby corrupting the feature representations required for accurate enumeration. To address this, we present CountOCC, an amodal counting framework that explicitly reconstructs occluded object features through hierarchical multimodal guidance. Rather than accepting degraded encodings, we synthesize complete representations by integrating spatial context from visible fragments with semantic priors from text and visual embeddings, generating class-discriminative features at occluded locations across multiple pyramid levels. We further introduce a visual equivalence objective that enforces consistency in attention space, ensuring that both occluded and unoccluded views of the same scene produce spatially aligned gradient-based attention maps. Together, these complementary mechanisms preserve discriminative properties essential for accurate counting under occlusion. For rigorous evaluation, we establish occlusion-augmented versions of FSC 147 and CARPK spanning both structured and unstructured scenes. CountOCC achieves SOTA performance on FSC 147 with 26.72% and 20.80% MAE reduction over prior baselines under occlusion in validation and test, respectively.

A puzzling issue is the fact that visual tokens most related to the query receive little to no attention in the final layers of the LLM module of VLMs from the answer tokens, where all tokens are treated equally, in particular, visual and language tokens in the LLM attention layers. This fact may result in wrong answers to visual questions, as our experimental results confirm. It appears that the standard next-token prediction (NTP) loss provides an insufficient signal for directing attention to visual tokens. We hypothesize that a more direct supervision of the attention of visual tokens to corresponding language tokens in the LLM module of VLMs will lead to improved performance on visual tasks. To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, we propose a novel loss function that directly supervises the attention of visual tokens. It directly grounds the answer language tokens in images by directing their attention to the relevant visual tokens. This is achieved by aligning the attention distribution of visual tokens to ground truth attention maps with KL divergence. The ground truth attention maps are obtained from task geometry in synthetic cases or from standard grounding annotations (e.g., bounding boxes or point annotations) in real images, and are used inside the LLM for attention supervision without requiring new labels. The obtained KL attention loss (KLAL) when combined with NTP encourages VLMs to attend to relevant visual tokens while generating answer tokens. This results in notable improvements across geometric tasks, pointing, and referring expression comprehension on both synthetic and real-world data, as demonstrated by our experiments. We also introduce a new dataset to evaluate the line tracing abilities of VLMs. Surprisingly, even commercial VLMs do not perform well on this task."}

In our study, the targets include bark, leaf, soil, and miscellaneous materials. We propose a multi-target regression approach in the context of imbalanced learning using Kernel Point Convolutions (KPConv). Our research leverages cost-sensitive learning to address class imbalance called density-based relevance (DBR). We employ weighted Mean Saquared Erorr (MSE), Focal Regression (FocalR), and regularization to improve the optimization of KPConv. This study performs a sensitivity analysis on the voxel size (0.25 - 2 meters) to evaluate the effect of various grid representations in capturing the nuances of the forest. This sensitivity analysis reveals that larger voxel sizes (e.g., 2 meters) result in lower errors due to reduced variability, while smaller voxel sizes (e.g., 0.25 or 0.5 meter) exhibit higher errors, particularly within the canopy, where variability is greatest. For bark and leaf targets, error values at smaller voxel size datasets (0.25 and 0.5 meter) were significantly higher than those in larger voxel size datasets (2 meters), highlighting the difficulty in accurately estimating within-canopy voxel content at fine resolutions.

Our insight is that many challenges associated with saliency-guided training stem from the placement of the guidance approaches solely within the image space. Instead, we move away from the image space, use the model's latent space embeddings to steer human guidance during training, and we propose SAGE (Saliency-Guided Contrastive Embeddings): a loss function that integrates human saliency into network training using contrastive embeddings.

This perspective opens up new possibilities for understanding the geometry of embedding space. For example, when interpolating between embeddings of two distinct prompts, we propose reframing the interpolation problem as an optimal transport problem. By solving this optimal transport problem, we compute a shortest path (or geodesic) between embeddings that captures a more natural and geometrically smooth transition through the embedding space. This results in smoother and more coherent intermediate (interpolated) images when rendered by the Stable Diffusion generative model. We conduct experiments to investigate this effect, comparing the quality of interpolated images produced using optimal transport to those generated by other standard interpolation methods. The novel optimal transport--based approach presented indeed gives smoother image interpolations, suggesting that viewing the embeddings as point clouds (rather than as matrices) better reflects and leverages the geometry of the embedding space."}

While many sophisticated methods have been proposed for this task, current methods still struggle to precisely detect camouflaged objects in complex scenarios, especially with small and multiple objects, indicating room for improvement.

Using vCoT, we systematically compare image-only LVLMs with their video-finetuned counterparts, both with and without access to these transitional cues. Our experiments show that vCoT significantly improves the performance of image-only models on long-form video question answering, while yielding only marginal gains for video-finetuned models.

In this study, we propose View-aware Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ViCoKD), a framework that distills knowledge from a fully supervised multi-modal teacher to a modality- and annotation-limited student. ViCoKD employs a cross-modal adapter with cross-modal attention, allowing the student to exploit multi-modal correlations while operating with incomplete modalities. Moreover, we propose a View-aware Consistency module to address view misalignment, where the same action may appear differently or only partially across viewpoints. It enforces prediction alignment when the action is co-visible across views, guided by human-detection masks and confidence-weighted Jensen-Shannon divergence between their predicted class distributions.

Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., \"how to interact\"). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., \"when to interact\") is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks.

Motivated by the cognitive understanding that creativity can emerge from both what is drawn (content) and how it is drawn (style), we reinterpret the creativity score as a function of these two complementary dimensions.Specifically, we first augment an existing creativity labeled dataset with additional annotations targeting content categories. Based on the enriched dataset, we further propose a multi-modal, multi-task learning framework that simultaneously predicts creativity scores, categorizes content types, and extracts stylistic features.

ActVAR decomposes feedforward networks (FFNs) into lightweight expert sub-networks and employs a learnable router to dynamically select token-specific expert subsets based on content. Simultaneously, a gated token selector identifies high-update-potential tokens for computation while reconstructing unselected tokens to preserve global context and sequence alignment.

However, such simulated anomalies lack the biophysical fidelity and morphological complexity characteristic of true clinical lesions. To advance UAD in brain MRI, we conduct the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of pathological signatures, revealing two key properties: (1) anomalies exhibit unique frequency patterns distinguishable from normal anatomy, and (2) low-frequency signals maintain consistent representations across healthy scans. These insights motivate our Frequency-Decomposition Preprocessing (FDP) framework, the first UAD method to leverage frequency-domain reconstruction for simultaneous pathology suppression and anatomical preservation. FDP can integrate seamlessly with existing anomaly simulation techniques, consistently enhancing detection performance across diverse architectures while maintaining diagnostic fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FDP consistently improves anomaly detection performance when integrated with existing methods.

To address this gap, we introduce DeepSport, the first end-to-end trained MLLM framework designed for multi-task, multi-sport video understanding. DeepSport shifts the paradigm from passive frame processing to active, iterative reasoning, empowering the model to ``think with videos'' by dynamically interrogating content via a specialized frame-extraction tool.

This motivates us to develop a more generalizable 3D model that can effectively detect anomalies without relying on task-specific designs.

To address these challenges, we propose ProtoAnomalyNCD, a prototype-learning-based framework for discovering unseen anomaly classes of multiple types that can be integrated with various anomaly detection methods. First, to suppress background clutter, we leverage Grounded SAM with text prompts to localize object regions as priors for the anomaly classification network. Next, because anomalies usually appear as subtle and fine-grained patterns on the product, we introduce an Anomaly-Map-Guided Attention block. Within this block, we design a Region Guidance Factor that helps the attention module distinguish among background, object regions, and anomalous regions. By using both localized product regions and anomaly maps as priors, the module enhances anomalous features while suppressing background noise and preserving normal features for contrastive learning. Finally, under a unified prototype-learning framework, ProtoAnomalyNCD discovers and clusters unseen anomaly classes while simultaneously enabling multi-type anomaly classification. We further extend our method to detect unseen outliers, achieving task-level unification. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the MVTec AD, MTD, and Real-IAD datasets."}

Impressive progress has been achieved by learning-based algorithms which require LDR-HDR image pairs. However, these pairs are hard to obtain, which motivates researchers to delve into the problem of annotation-efficient HDR image reconstructing: how to achieve comparable performance with limited HDR ground truths (GTs). This work attempts to address this problem from the view of semi-supervised learning where a teacher model generates pseudo HDR GTs for the LDR samples without GTs and a student model learns from pseudo GTs. Nevertheless, the confirmation bias, i.e., the student may learn from the artifacts in pseudo HDR GTs, presents an impediment. To remove this impediment, an uncertainty-based masking process is proposed to discard unreliable parts of pseudo GTs at both pixel and patch levels, then the trusted areas can be learned from by the student. With this novel masking process, our semi-supervised HDR reconstructing method not only outperforms previous annotation-efficient algorithms, but also achieves comparable performance with up-to-date fully-supervised methods by using only 6.7% HDR GTs."}

This paper introduces MCAQ-YOLO, a morphological complexity-aware quantization framework for object detection. The framework employs five morphological metrics - fractal dimension, texture entropy, gradient variance, edge density, and contour complexity - to characterize local visual morphology and guide spatially adaptive bit allocation. By correlating these metrics with quantization sensitivity, MCAQ-YOLO dynamically adjusts bit precision according to spatial complexity. In addition, a curriculum-based quantization-aware training scheme progressively increases quantization difficulty to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between morphological complexity and quantization sensitivity and show that MCAQ-YOLO achieves superior detection accuracy and convergence efficiency compared with uniform quantization. On a safety equipment dataset, MCAQ-YOLO attains 85.6 percent mAP@0.5 with an average of 4.2 bits and a 7.6x compression ratio, yielding 3.5 percentage points higher mAP than uniform 4-bit quantization while introducing only 1.8 ms of additional runtime overhead per image.

In this paper, we present ArtiWorld, a scene-aware pipeline that localizes candidate articulable objects from textual scene descriptions and reconstructs executable URDF models that preserve the original geometry. At the core of this pipeline is Arti4URDF, which leverages 3D point cloud, prior knowledge of a large language model (LLM), and a URDF-oriented prompt design to rapidly convert rigid objects into interactive URDF-based articulated objects while maintaining their 3D shape. We evaluate ArtiWorld at three levels: 3D simulated objects, full 3D simulated scenes, and real-world scan scenes. Across all three settings, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving object geometry and correctly capturing object interactivity to produce usable URDF-based articulated models.

CCI sets a new state of the art on faithfulness benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by large margins; for example, it yields more than a twofold improvement on the deletion-AUC metric for MS COCO retrieval. We further propose that CCI, when combined with GroundedSAM, automatically categorizes predictions as foreground- or background-driven, providing a crucial diagnostic ability. Existing benchmarks such as CounterAnimals, however, rely solely on accuracy and implicitly attribute all performance degradation to background correlations. Our analysis shows this assumption to be incomplete, since many errors arise from viewpoint variation, scale shifts, and fine-grained object confusions. To disentangle these effects, we introduce COVAR, a benchmark that systematically varies object foregrounds and backgrounds.

Dataset pruning addresses this challenge by constructing a compact but informative coreset from the full dataset with comparable performance. Previous approaches typically establish scoring metrics based on specific criteria to identify representative samples. However, these methods predominantly rely on sample scores obtained from the model's performance during the training (i.e., fitting) phase. As scoring models achieve near-optimal performance on training data, such fitting-centric approaches induce a dense distribution of sample scores within a narrow numerical range. This concentration reduces the distinction between samples and hinders effective selection. To address this challenge, we conduct dataset pruning from the perspective of generalization, i.e., scoring samples based on models not exposed to them during training. We propose a plug-and-play framework, UNSEEN, which can be integrated into existing dataset pruning methods. Additionally, conventional score-based methods are single-step and rely on models trained solely on the complete dataset, providing limited perspective on the importance of samples. To address this limitation, we scale UNSEEN to multi-step scenarios and propose an incremental selection technique through scoring models trained on varying coresets, and optimize the quality of the coreset dynamically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K.

Characterized by two significant advancements: the determination of an weighted semantic map and the auto-adaptive candidate editing sequence. First, the generation of the weighted semantic map is designed to maximize the reduction of non-semantic feature units that need to be computed, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. Second, the auto-adaptive candidate editing sequences are designed to determine the optimal computational order among the feature units to be processed, thereby ensuring the efficient generation of counterfactuals while maintaining the semantic relevance of the replacement feature units to the target object.

This bias significantly impairs the robustness of pre-trained CLIP models on out-of-distribution data, where such cross-modal associations no longer hold. Existing methods for mitigating multimodal spurious bias typically require fine-tuning on downstream data or prior knowledge of the bias, which undermines the out-of-the-box usability of CLIP. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the impact of multimodal spurious bias in zero-shot classification. Based on this insight, we propose Spuriousness-Aware Guided Exploration (SAGE), a simple and effective method that mitigates spurious bias through guided prompt selection. SAGE requires no training, fine-tuning, or external annotations. It explores a space of prompt templates and selects the prompts that induce the largest semantic separation between classes, thereby improving worst-group robustness.

To address this, we present DTGS, a unified framework that tightly couples Retinex-inspired illumination decomposition with thermal-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for illumination-invariant reconstruction. Unlike prior approaches that treat enhancement as a pre-processing step, DTGS performs joint optimization across enhancement, geometry, and thermal supervision through a cyclic enhancement-reconstruction mechanism. A thermal supervisory branch stabilizes both color restoration and geometry learning by dynamically balancing enhancement, structural, and thermal losses. Moreover, a Retinex-based decomposition module embedded within the 3DGS loop provides physically interpretable reflectance-illumination separation, ensuring consistent color and texture across viewpoints. To evaluate our method, we construct RGBT-LOW, a new multi-view low-light thermal dataset capturing severe illumination degradation.

In practice, it is often used as a latent MF by leveraging the pre-trained Stable Diffusion variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for high-dimensional data modeling. However, MF training remains computationally demanding and is often unstable. During inference, the SD-VAE decoder dominates the generation cost, and MF depends on complex guidance hyperparameters for class-conditional generation. In this work, we develop an efficient training and sampling scheme for MF in the latent space of a Representation Autoencoder (RAE), where a pre-trained vision encoder (e.g., DINO) provides semantically rich latents paired with a lightweight decoder. We observe that naive MF training in the RAE latent space suffers from severe gradient explosion. To stabilize and accelerate training, we adopt Consistency Mid-Training for trajectory-aware initialization and use a two-stage scheme: distillation from a pre-trained flow matching teacher to speed convergence and reduce variance, followed by an optional bootstrapping stage with a one-point velocity estimator to further reduce deviation from the oracle mean flow. This design removes the need for guidance, simplifies training configurations, and reduces computation in both training and sampling. Empirically, our method achieves a 1-step FID of 2.03, outperforming vanilla MF's 3.43, while reducing sampling GFLOPS by 38% and total training cost by 83% on ImageNet 256.

To tackle this, we propose SpectralAdapt, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that bridges the domain gap between general and human-centered HSI datasets. To fully exploit limited labels and abundant unlabeled data, we enhance spectral reasoning by introducing Spectral Density Masking (SDM), which adaptively masks RGB channels based on their spectral complexity, encouraging recovery of informative regions from complementary cues during consistency training. Furthermore, we introduce Spectral Endmember Representation Alignment (SERA), which derives physically interpretable endmembers from valuable labeled pixels and employs them as domain-invariant anchors to guide unlabeled predictions, with momentum updates ensuring adaptability and stability. These components are seamlessly integrated into SpectralAdapt, a spectral prior-guided framework that effectively mitigates domain shift, spectral degradation, and data scarcity in HSI reconstruction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity, cross-domain generalization, and training stability, highlighting the promise of SSDA as an efficient solution for hyperspectral imaging in healthcare."}

However, when directly applied to long-form video understanding scenarios, they exhibit clear limitations. The fundamental reasons for this lie in two points: (1)long-form video understanding involves richer and more dynamic visual input, meaning rethinking only the text information is insufficient and necessitates a further rethinking process specifically targeting visual information; (2) purely text-based reflection mechanisms lack cross-modal interaction capabilities, preventing them from fully integrating visual information during reflection. Motivated by these insights, we propose REVISOR (REflective VIsual Segment Oriented Reasoning), a novel framework for tool-augmented multimodal reflection. REVISOR enables MLLMs to collaboratively construct introspective reflection processes across textual and visual modalities, significantly enhancing their reasoning capability for long-form video understanding. To ensure that REVISOR can learn to accurately review video segments highly relevant to the question during reinforcement learning, we designed the Dual Attribution Decoupled Reward (DADR) mechanism. Integrated into the GRPO training strategy, this mechanism enforces causal alignment between the model's reasoning and the selected video evidence.

To address this limitation, we propose Ocean, an object-centric prediction framework that decomposes the scene into individual object instances to enable more accurate semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight segmentation model, MobileSAM, to extract instance masks from the input image.

This enables consistent relational reasoning and compound interaction modeling. Motion generation is formulated as joint-wise probabilistic prediction over the UIV, allowing the model to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies and produce coherent, context-aware behaviors.

In video tasks, such strategies frequently underutilize rich visual information, leading to potential shortcut learning and increased susceptibility to hallucination. To foster a more robust, visual-centric video understanding, we start by introducing a novel self-supervised reinforcement learning GRPO algorithm (Pretext-GRPO) within the standard R1 pipeline, in which positive rewards are assigned for correctly solving pretext tasks on transformed visual inputs, which makes the model to non-trivially process the visual information. Building on the effectiveness of Pretext-GRPO, we further propose the ViSS-R1 framework, which streamlines and integrates pretext-task-based self-supervised learning directly into the MLLM's R1 post-training paradigm. Instead of relying solely on sparse visual cues, our framework compels models to reason about transformed visual input by simultaneously processing both pretext questions (concerning transformations) and true user queries. This necessitates identifying the applied transformation and reconstructing the original video to formulate accurate final answers. Comprehensive evaluations on six widely-used video reasoning and understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our Pretext-GRPO and ViSS-R1 for complex video reasoning.

However, existing architectures remain constrained by an over-reliance on ego status, hindering generalization and robust scene understanding. We identify the root cause as an inherent design within these architectures that allows ego status to be easily leveraged as a shortcut. Specifically, the premature fusion of ego status in the upstream BEV encoder allows an information flow from this strong prior to dominate the downstream planning module. To address this challenge, we propose AdaptiveAD, an architectural-level solution based on a multi-context fusion strategy. Its core is a dual-branch structure that explicitly decouples scene perception and ego status. One branch performs scene-driven reasoning based on multi-task learning, but with ego status deliberately omitted from the BEV encoder, while the other conducts ego-driven reasoning based solely on the planning task. A scene-aware fusion module then adaptively integrates the complementary decisions from the two branches to form the final planning trajectory. To ensure this decoupling does not compromise multi-task learning, we introduce a path attention mechanism for ego-BEV interaction and add two targeted auxiliary tasks: BEV unidirectional distillation and autoregressive online mapping. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that AdaptiveAD achieves state-of-the-art open-loop planning performance. Crucially, it significantly mitigates the over-reliance on ego status and exhibits impressive generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios."}

This many-to-one mapping allows distilled data to capture shared semantics and achieve information compression. In contrast, low-level tasks involve a many-to-many mapping that requires pixel-level fidelity, making low-level DD an underdetermined problem, as a small distilled dataset cannot fully constrain the dense pixel-level mappings. To address this, we propose the first low-level DD method for medical image enhancement. We first leverage anatomical similarities across patients to construct the shared anatomical prior based on a representative patient, which serves as the initialization for the distilled data of different patients. This prior is then personalized for each patient using a Structure-Preserving Personalized Generation (SPG) module, which integrates patient-specific anatomical information into the distilled dataset while preserving pixel-level fidelity. For different low-level tasks, the distilled data is used to construct task-specific high- and low-quality training pairs. Patient-specific knowledge is injected into the distilled data by aligning the gradients computed from networks trained on the distilled pairs with those from the corresponding patient's raw data.

However, when dealing with complex scenes, existing methods often struggle to strike a balance between fine-grained feature representation of inhomogeneous haze distribution and global consistency modeling. Furthermore, to better learn the common degenerate representation of haze in spatial variations, we propose an unsupervised dehaze method for implicit neural degradation representation. Firstly, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose a mechanism combining the channel-independent and channel-dependent mechanisms, which efficiently enhances the ability to learn from nonlinear dependencies. which in turn achieves good visual perception in complex scenes. Moreover, we design an implicit neural representation to model haze degradation as a continuous function to eliminate redundant information and the dependence on explicit feature extraction and physical models. To further learn the implicit representation of the haze features, we also designed a dense residual enhancement module from it to eliminate redundant information. This achieves high-quality image restoration. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive dehaze performance on various public and real-world datasets.

To address this problem, we propose a novel Rotationally Invariant Features (RIF) framework for 3D AD. Firstly, to remove the adverse effect of variations on point cloud data, we develop a Point Coordinate Mapping (PCM) technique, which maps each point into a rotationally invariant space to maintain consistency of representation. Then, to learn robust and discriminative features, we design a lightweight Convolutional Transform Feature Network (CTF-Net) to extract rotationally invariant features for the memory bank. To improve the ability of the feature extractor, we introduce the idea of transfer learning to pre-train the feature extractor with 3D data augmentation.

Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong temporal reasoning capabilities, making them a promising tool for enhancing reconstruction quality under sparse-view settings.

In this paper, we present a diffusion-based framework, called CloseUpShot, for close-up novel view synthesis from sparse inputs via point-conditioned video diffusion. Specifically, we observe that pixel-warping conditioning suffers from severe sparsity and background leakage in close-up settings. To address this, we propose hierarchical warping and occlusion-aware noise suppression, enhancing the quality and completeness of the conditioning images for the video diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce global structure guidance, which leverages a dense fused point cloud to provide consistent geometric context to the diffusion process, to compensate for the lack of globally consistent 3D constraints in sparse conditioning inputs. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, especially in close-up novel view synthesis, clearly validating the effectiveness of our design."}

To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models."}

In this work, we focus on indoor lighting, an intrinsic yet largely overlooked scene attribute that strongly influences navigation. We propose Indoor Lighting-based Adversarial Attack (ILA), a black-box framework that manipulates global illumination to disrupt VLN agents. Motivated by typical household lighting usage, we design two attack modes: Static Indoor Lighting-based Attack (SILA), where the lighting intensity remains constant throughout an episode, and Dynamic Indoor Lighting-based Attack (DILA), where lights are switched on or off at critical moments to induce abrupt illumination changes. We evaluate ILA on two state-of-the-art VLN models across three navigation tasks. Results show that ILA significantly increases failure rates while reducing trajectory efficiency, revealing previously unrecognized vulnerabilities of VLN agents to realistic indoor lighting variations."}

In this work, we take a bold departure from text-based paradigms by introducing the first skeleton-driven pretraining framework for ReID. To achieve this, we propose Contrastive Skeleton-Image Pretraining for ReID (CSIP-ReID), a novel two-stage method that leverages skeleton sequences as a spatiotemporally informative modality aligned with video frames. In the first stage, we employ contrastive learning to align skeleton and visual features at sequence level. In the second stage, we introduce a dynamic Prototype Fusion Updater (PFU) to refine multimodal identity prototypes, fusing motion and appearance cues. Moreover, we propose a Skeleton Guided Temporal Modeling (SGTM) module that distills temporal cues from skeleton data and integrates them into visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSIP-ReID achieves new state-of-the-art results on standard video ReID benchmarks (MARS, LS-VID, iLIDS-VID).

However, such gradient cues have not been effectively leveraged in deep learning frameworks for SAR-Optical image matching. To address this gap, we propose SOMA, a dense registration framework that integrates structural gradient priors into deep features and refines alignment through a hybrid matching strategy. Specifically, we introduce the Feature Gradient Enhancer (FGE), which embeds multi-scale, multi-directional gradient filters into the feature space using attention and reconstruction mechanisms to boost feature distinctiveness. Furthermore, we propose the Global-Local Affine-Flow Matcher (GLAM), which combines affine transformation and flow-based refinement within a coarse-to-fine architecture to ensure both structural consistency and local accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SOMA significantly improves registration precision, increasing the CMR@1px by 12.29% on the SEN1-2 dataset and 18.50% on the GFGE_SO dataset.

In this paper, we address two important aspects in XMC: how to effectively harness larger decoder-only models, and how to exploit visual information while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate that both play a critical role in XMC separately and can be combined for improved performance. We show that a few billion-size decoder can deliver substantial improvements while keeping computational overhead manageable.

To address this limitation, we propose Object-Centric 3D Rollout (OCR), a novel strategy that introduces structured perturbations to the 3D geometry of selected objects during training. By degrading object-specific visual cues and projecting the altered geometry into 2D space, OCR compels the model to reason holistically across the entire scene.

However, existing methods often oversimplify the anomaly space by treating all abnormal events as a single category, overlooking the diverse semantic and temporal characteristics intrinsic to real-world anomalies. Inspired by how humans perceive anomalies, by jointly interpreting temporal motion patterns and semantic structures underlying different anomaly types, we propose RefineVAD, a novel framework that mimics this dual-process reasoning. Our framework integrates two core modules. The first, Motion-aware Temporal Attention and Recalibration (MoTAR), estimates motion salience and dynamically adjusts temporal focus via shift-based attention and global Transformer-based modeling. The second, Category-Oriented Refinement (CORE), injects soft anomaly category priors into the representation space by aligning segment-level features with learnable category prototypes through cross-attention. By jointly leveraging temporal dynamics and semantic structure, explicitly models both \"how\" motion evolves and \"what\" semantic category it resembles. Extensive experiments on WVAD benchmark validate the effectiveness of RefineVAD and highlight the importance of integrating semantic context to guide feature refinement toward anomaly-relevant patterns."}

This design relies on heuristic operations such as detection, RoI cropping, and non-maximum suppression (NMS), limiting both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present a fully end-to-end framework for multi-person 2D pose estimation in videos, effectively eliminating heuristic operations. A key challenge is to associate individuals across frames under complex and overlapping temporal trajectories. To address this, we introduce a novel Pose-Aware Video transformEr Network (PAVE-Net), which features a spatial encoder to model intra-frame relations and a spatiotemporal pose decoder to capture global dependencies across frames. To achieve accurate temporal association, we propose a pose-aware attention mechanism that enables each pose query to selectively aggregate features corresponding to the same individual across consecutive frames.Additionally, we explicitly model spatiotemporal dependencies among pose keypoints to improve accuracy. Notably, our approach is the first end-to-end method for multi-frame 2D human pose estimation.Extensive experiments show that PAVE-Net substantially outperforms prior image-based end-to-end methods, achieving a \\textbf{6.0} mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017, and delivers accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art two-stage video-based approaches, while offering significant gains in efficiency.Project page: https://github.com/zgspose/PAVENet"}

To overcome this limitation, we introduce 3DAlign-DAER, a unified framework designed to align text and 3D geometry via the proposed dynamic attention policy and the efficient retrieval strategy, capturing subtle correspondences for diverse cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks. Specifically, during the training, our proposed dynamic attention policy (DAP) employs the Hierarchical Attention Fusion (HAF) module to represent the alignment as learnable fine-grained token-to-point attentions. To optimize these attentions across different tasks and geometric hierarchies, our DAP further exploits the Monte Carlo tree search to dynamically calibrate HAF attention weights via a hybrid reward signal and further enhances the alignment between textual descriptions and local 3D geometry. During the inference, our 3DAlign-DAER introduces an Efficient Retrieval Strategy (ERS) to leverage efficient hierarchical searching in the large-scale embedding spaces, outperforming traditional methods (e.g., KNN) in accuracy and efficiency.

The emerged misinformation with low creation cost and high deception poses significant threats to society. While recent studies leverage general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve remarkable results in detection, they encounter two critical limitations: (1) Insufficient reasoning, where general-purpose MLLMs often follow the uniform reasoning paradigm but generate inaccurate explanations and judgments, due to the lack of the task-specific knowledge of multimodal misinformation detection. (2) Reasoning biases, where a single thinking mode make detectors a suboptimal path for judgment, struggling to keep pace with the fast-growing and intricate multimodal misinformation. In this paper, we propose MMD-Thinker, a two-stage framework for multimodal misinformation detection through adaptive multi-dimensional thinking. First, we develop tailor-designed thinking mode for multimodal misinformation detection. Second, we adopt task-specific instruction tuning to inject the tailored thinking mode into general-purpose MLLMs. Third, we further leverage reinforcement learning strategy with a mixed advantage function, which incentivizes the reasoning capabilities in trajectories.

Therefore, we propose RFMNet, which utilizes features from multiple encoding stages of the reference salient images and performs interactive fusion with the camouflage features at the corresponding encoding stages. Given that the features in salient object images contain abundant object-related detail information, performing feature fusion within local areas is more beneficial for detecting camouflaged objects.

However, most tools classify only overall image quality, without indicating acquisition defects to guide recapture. This gap is mainly due to the high cost of detailed annotations. In this paper, we aim to mitigate this limitation by introducing a hybrid semi-supervised learning approach that combines manual labels for overall quality with pseudo-labels of quality details within a multi-task framework. Our objective is to obtain more interpretable RIQA models without requiring extensive manual labeling. Pseudo-labels are generated by a Teacher model trained on a small dataset and then used to fine-tune a pre-trained model in a multi-task setting. Using a ResNet-18 backbone, we show that these weak annotations improve quality assessment over single-task baselines (F1: 0.875 vs. 0.863 on EyeQ, and 0.778 vs. 0.763 on DeepDRiD), matching or surpassing existing methods. The multi-task model achieved performance statistically comparable to the Teacher for most detail prediction tasks (p > 0.05). In a newly annotated EyeQ subset released with this paper, our model performed similarly to experts, suggesting that pseudo-label noise aligns with expert variability. Our main finding is that the proposed semi-supervised approach not only improves overall quality assessment but also provides interpretable feedback on capture conditions (illumination, clarity, contrast). This enhances interpretability at no extra manual labeling cost and offers clinically actionable outputs to guide image recapture."}

However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose TripleFDS, a novel framework for STE with disentangled modular attributes, and an accompanying dataset called SCB Synthesis. SCB Synthesis provides robust training data for triple feature disentanglement by utilizing the \"SCB Group\", a novel construct that combines three attributes per image to generate diverse, disentangled training groups. Leveraging this construct as a basic training unit, TripleFDS first disentangles triple features, ensuring semantic accuracy through inter-group contrastive regularization and reducing redundancy through intra-sample multi-feature orthogonality. In the synthesis phase, TripleFDS performs feature remapping to prevent \"shortcut\" phenomena during reconstruction and mitigate potential feature leakage. Trained on 125,000 SCB Groups, TripleFDS achieves state-of-the-art image fidelity (SSIM of 44.54) and text accuracy (ACC of 93.58%) on the mainstream STE benchmarks.

DelAnyFlow combines the DelAny instance segmentation model, based on a YOLOv11 backbone and trained on the large-scale Field Boundary Instance Segmentation-22M (FBIS 22M) dataset, with a structured post-processing, merging, and vectorization sequence to generate topologically consistent vector boundaries.

However, little attention has been paid to hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks, e.g., story writing, where the models are expected to generate novel content beyond the given image. In these tasks, it is inappropriate to simply regard such imagined novel content as hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce Voluntary-imagined Object Presence Evaluation (VOPE)-a novel method to assess LVLMs' hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks via presence evaluation. Specifically, VOPE poses recheck-based questions to evaluate how an LVLM interprets the presence of the imagined objects in its own response. The consistency between the model's interpretation and the object's presence in the image is then used to determine whether the model hallucinates when generating the response. We apply VOPE to several mainstream LVLMs and hallucination mitigation methods, revealing two key findings: (1) most LVLMs hallucinate heavily during voluntary imagination, and their performance in presence evaluation is notably poor on imagined objects; (2) existing hallucination mitigation methods show limited effect in voluntary imagination tasks, making this an important direction for future research."}

Given a source and a target shape, the composition of the inverse flow (source to anchor) with the forward flow (anchor to target), we continuously map points between the two surfaces. By encoding the shapes with a pointwise task-tailored embedding, this construction provides an invertible and modality-agnostic representation of maps between shapes across point clouds, meshes, signed distance fields (SDFs), and volumetric data.

Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations.

Yet, they are often distributed in a static raster format, which limits editing and customization. Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline."}

However, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation of whether the demolished land has been effectively reused, raising concerns about the efficacy and sustainability of current redevelopment practices. To address the gap, this study proposes a deep learning-based framework to monitor the spatiotemporal changes of UVs in China. Specifically, semantic segmentation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is first used to map evolving UV boundaries, and then post-demolition land use is classified into six categories based on the \"remained-demolished-redeveloped\" phase: incomplete demolition, vacant land, construction sites, buildings, green spaces, and others. Four representative cities from China's four economic regions were selected as the study areas, i.e., Guangzhou (East), Zhengzhou (Central), Xi'an (West), and Harbin (Northeast). The results indicate: 1) UV redevelopment processes were frequently prolonged; 2) redevelopment transitions primarily occurred in peripheral areas, whereas urban cores remained relatively stable; and 3) three spatiotemporal transformation pathways, i.e., synchronized redevelopment, delayed redevelopment, and gradual optimization, were revealed. This study highlights the fragmented, complex and nonlinear nature of UV redevelopment, underscoring the need for tiered and context-sensitive planning strategies. By linking spatial dynamics with the context of redevelopment policies, the findings offer valuable empirical insights that support more inclusive, efficient, and sustainable urban renewal, while also contributing to a broader global understanding of informal settlement transformations."}

In this work, we reveal a new class of attacks that compromise model interpretability without affecting accuracy. Specifically, we show that small color perturbations applied by adversarial clients in a federated learning setting can shift a model's saliency maps away from semantically meaningful regions while keeping the prediction unchanged. The proposed saliency-aware attack framework, called Chromatic Perturbation Module, systematically crafts adversarial examples by altering the color contrast between foreground and background in a way that disrupts explanation fidelity. These perturbations accumulate across training rounds, poisoning the global model's internal feature attributions in a stealthy and persistent manner. Our findings challenge a common assumption in model auditing that correct predictions imply faithful explanations and demonstrate that interpretability itself can be an attack surface. We evaluate this vulnerability across multiple datasets and show that standard training pipelines are insufficient to detect or mitigate explanation degradation, especially in the federated learning setting, where subtle color perturbations are harder to discern. Our attack reduces peak activation overlap in Grad-CAM explanations by up to 35% while preserving classification accuracy above 96% on all evaluated datasets."}

BootOOD synthesizes pseudo-OOD features through simple transformations of ID representations and leverages Neural Collapse (NC), where ID features cluster tightly around class means with consistent feature norms. Unlike prior approaches that aim to constrain OOD features into subspaces orthogonal to the collapsed ID means, BootOOD introduces a lightweight auxiliary head that performs radius-based classification on feature norms.

In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal contrastive learning models against such attacks. In particular, given a poisoned CLIP model, our approach can identify the backdoor trigger and pinpoint the victim samples and labels in an efficient manner. To that end, an image segmentation ``oracle'' is introduced as the supervisor for the output of the poisoned CLIP. We develop two algorithms to rectify the poisoned model: (1) differentiating between CLIP and Oracle's knowledge to identify potential triggers; (2) pinpointing affected labels and victim samples, and curating a compact fine-tuning dataset. With this knowledge, we are allowed to rectify the poisoned CLIP model to negate backdoor effects. Extensive experiments on visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate our strategy is effective in CLIP-based backdoor defense."}

While deep learning has significantly advanced the capabilities of monocular height estimation, these methods remain fundamentally limited by the availability of labeled data, which are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain at scale. The scarcity of high-quality annotations hinders the generalization and performance of existing models. To overcome this limitation, we propose leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data through a semi-supervised learning framework, enabling the model to extract informative cues from unlabeled samples and improve its predictive performance. In this work, we introduce TSE-Net, a self-training pipeline for semi-supervised monocular height estimation. The pipeline integrates teacher, student, and exam networks. The student network is trained on unlabeled data using pseudo-labels generated by the teacher network, while the exam network functions as a temporal ensemble of the student network to stabilize performance. The teacher network is formulated as a joint regression and classification model: the regression branch predicts height values that serve as pseudo-labels, and the classification branch predicts height value classes along with class probabilities, which are used to filter pseudo-labels. Height value classes are defined using a hierarchical bi-cut strategy to address the inherent long-tailed distribution of heights, and the predicted class probabilities are calibrated with a Plackett-Luce model to reflect the expected accuracy of pseudo-labels.

Although both tasks share a common retrieval objective, they pose distinct challenges: I2I emphasizes discriminative identity learning, while T2I requires accurate cross-modal semantic alignment. Existing methods often treat these tasks separately, which may lead to representation entanglement and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a unified framework named Hierarchical Prompt Learning (HPL), which leverages task-aware prompt modeling to jointly optimize both tasks. Specifically, we first introduce a Task-Routed Transformer, which incorporates dual classification tokens into a shared visual encoder to route features for I2I and T2I branches respectively. On top of this, we develop a hierarchical prompt generation scheme that integrates identity-level learnable tokens with instance-level pseudo-text tokens. These pseudo-tokens are derived from image or text features via modality-specific inversion networks, injecting fine-grained, instance-specific semantics into the prompts. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal Prompt Regularization strategy to enforce semantic alignment in the prompt token space, ensuring that pseudo-prompts preserve source-modality characteristics while enhancing cross-modal transferability. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both I2I and T2I tasks."}

Existing tile-based models can capture detailed nuclear morphology but often fail to incorporate the broader tissue context that influences a cell's function and identity. In addition, available human annotations are typically coarse-grained and unevenly distributed across studies, making fine-grained subtype-level supervision difficult to obtain.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce NuClass, a pathologist workflow inspired framework for cell-wise multi-scale integration of nuclear morphology and microenvironmental context. NuClass includes two main components: Path local, which focuses on nuclear morphology from 224-by-224 pixel crops, and Path global, which models the surrounding 1024-by-1024 pixel neighborhood. A learnable gating module adaptively balances local detail and contextual cues. To encourage complementary learning, we incorporate an uncertainty-guided objective that directs the global path to prioritize regions where the local path is uncertain. We also provide calibrated confidence estimates and Grad-CAM visualizations to enhance interpretability.\n  To overcome the lack of high-quality annotations, we construct a marker-guided dataset from Xenium spatial transcriptomics assays, yielding single-cell resolution labels for more than two million cells across eight organs and 16 classes. Evaluated on three fully held-out cohorts, NuClass achieves up to 96 percent F1 for its best-performing class, outperforming strong baselines. Our results show that multi-scale, uncertainty-aware fusion can bridge the gap between slide-level pathological foundation models and reliable, cell-level phenotype prediction."}

Although speculative decoding (SD) has been proven effective for accelerating visual AR models, its \"draft one step, then verify one step\" paradigm prevents a direct reduction of the forward passes, thus restricting acceleration potential. Motivated by the visual token interchangeability, we for the first time to explore verification skipping in the SD process of visual AR model generation to explicitly cut the number of target model forward passes, thereby reducing inference latency. Based on an analysis of the drafting stage's characteristics, we observe that verification redundancy and stale feature reusability are key factors to retain generation quality and speedup for verification-free steps. Inspired by these two observations, we propose a novel SD framework VVS to accelerate visual AR generation via partial verification skipping, which integrates three complementary modules: (1) a verification-free token selector with dynamical truncation, (2) token-level feature caching and reuse, and (3) fine-grained skipped step scheduling. Consequently, VVS reduces the number of target model forward passes by a factor of $2.8\\times$ relative to vanilla AR decoding while maintaining competitive generation quality, offering a superior speed-quality trade-off over conventional SD frameworks and revealing strong potential to reshape the SD paradigm."}

HVI color space has made significant progress in this task by enabling precise decoupling of chrominance and luminance. However, for the interaction of chrominance and luminance branches, substantial distributional differences between the two branches prevalent in natural images limit complementary feature extraction, and luminance errors are propagated to chrominance channels through the nonlinear parameter. Furthermore, for interaction between different chrominance branches, images with large homogeneous-color regions usually exhibit weak correlation between chrominance branches due to concentrated distributions. Traditional pixel-wise losses exploit strong inter-branch correlations for co-optimization, causing gradient conflicts in weakly correlated regions. Therefore, we propose an Inter-Chrominance and Luminance Interaction (ICLR) framework including a Dual-stream Interaction Enhancement Module (DIEM) and a Covariance Correction Loss (CCL). The DIEM improves the extraction of complementary information from two dimensions, fusion and enhancement, respectively. The CCL utilizes luminance residual statistics to penalize chrominance errors and balances gradient conflicts by constraining chrominance branches covariance. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed ICLR framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations. We find that annotated conditional templates enable better registration than their unlabeled unconditional counterparts, and outperform other templates construction methods."}

The Face Mesh by MediaPipe is a lightweight framework that can identify facial landmarks with high accuracy and efficiency, which is considered to be important in real time use. The system detects the moments of long eye shutdowns or a very low rate of blinking which are manifestations of drowsiness and alerts the driver through sound to get her attention back. This system achieves a high-performance and low-cost driver monitoring solution with the help of the computational power of OpenCV to process the image and the MediaPipe to identify faces.

Recently introduced $α$-divergence loss functions offer a compelling alternative, particularly for their ability to induce sparse solutions (when $α>1$). However, integrating an angular margin-crucial for verification tasks-is not straightforward. We find this integration can be achieved in at least two distinct ways: via the reference measure (prior probabilities) or via the logits (unnormalized log-likelihoods). In this paper, we explore both pathways, deriving two novel margin-based $α$-divergence losses: Q-Margin (margin in the reference measure) and A3M (margin in the logits). We identify and address a critical training instability in A3M-caused by the interplay of penalized logits and sparsity-with a simple yet effective prototype re-initialization strategy. Our methods achieve significant performance gains on the challenging IJB-B and IJB-C face verification benchmarks. We demonstrate similarly strong performance in speaker verification on VoxCeleb. Crucially, our models significantly outperform strong baselines at low false acceptance rates (FAR). This capability is crucial for practical high-security applications, such as banking authentication, when minimizing false authentications is paramount."}

DTD prunes per-patch tokens online via cosine similarity to the previous frame, and surviving tokens are packed into fixed-size blocks. This online, per-frame processing makes our approach fundamentally suited for live streaming VQA. As blocks are processed, each one's keys are summarized by a tiny recurrent encoder to form a retrieval index, while the block's full KV pairs are offloaded and later rehydrated for generation, preserving answer fidelity. At inference, a consensus-based retrieval mechanism retrieves only the Top-K most relevant blocks and attends over both the retrieved and local context for precise, long-range reasoning. CacheFlow is drop-in, architecture-agnostic, and requires no fine-tuning. Experiments on both offline and streaming VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CacheFlow outperforms current strong baselines, while processing up to 87% less tokens. Our dual approach enables VLMs to be both efficient and context-aware, paving the way for practical long-form video understanding."}

We show that for the RL of the few-step generator, the DMD loss itself is a more effective regularization compared to the traditional ones. In turn, RL can help to guide the mode coverage process in DMD more effectively. These allow us to unlock the capacity of the few-step generator by conducting distillation and RL simultaneously.

We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction."}

Code at https://github.com/LTH14/JiT", "summary": "Today's denoising diffusion models do not \"denoise\" in the classical sense, i.e., they do not directly predict clean images. Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than \"$\\textbf{Just image Transformers}$\", or $\\textbf{JiT}$, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data."}

Although climbing plants have been studied for a long time, extracting information regarding the relationship between the temporal shape change, the event that triggers it, and the contact location is still challenging. To help build this relation, we propose an image-based method by which it is possible to analyze shape changes over time in tendrils when mechano-stimulated in different portions of their body. We employ a geometric approach using a 3D Piece-Wise Clothoid-based model to reconstruct the configuration taken by a tendril after mechanical rubbing. The reconstruction shows high robustness and reliability with an accuracy of R2 > 0.99. This method demonstrates distinct advantages over deep learning-based approaches, including reduced data requirements, lower computational costs, and interpretability. Our analysis reveals higher responsiveness in the apical segment of tendrils, which might correspond to higher sensitivity and tissue flexibility in that region of the organs. Our study provides a methodology for gaining new insights into plant biomechanics and offers a foundation for designing and developing novel intelligent robotic systems inspired by climbing plants."}

Our pipeline isolates the basketball subset of SportsSloMo, extracts training triplets, and fine-tunes RIFE with human-aware random cropping. We compare the resulting model against Super SloMo and the baseline RIFE model using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) on held-out clips. The fine-tuned RIFE attains a mean PSNR of 34.3 dB and SSIM of 0.949, outperforming Super SloMo by 2.1 dB and the baseline RIFE by 1.3 dB. A lightweight Gradio interface demonstrates end-to-end 4x slow-motion generation on a single RTX 4070 Ti Super at approximately 30 fps.

To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight compression framework that leverages Range Asymmetric Numeral Systems (rANS) encoding with asymmetric integer quantization and sparse tensor representation to reduce transmission overhead dramatically. Specifically, our approach combines asymmetric integer quantization with a sparse representation technique, eliminating the need for complex probability modeling or network modifications. The key contributions include: (1) a distribution-agnostic compression pipeline that exploits inherent tensor sparsity to achieve bandwidth reduction with minimal computational overhead; (2) an approximate theoretical model that optimizes tensor reshaping dimensions to maximize compression efficiency; and (3) a GPU-accelerated implementation with sub-millisecond encoding/decoding latency. Extensive evaluations across diverse neural architectures (ResNet, VGG16, MobileNetV2, SwinT, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0) demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently maintains near-baseline accuracy across CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks. Moreover, we validated the framework's effectiveness on advanced natural language processing tasks by employing Llama2 7B and 13B on standard benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, ARC, PIQA, Winogrande, BoolQ, and OpenBookQA, demonstrating its broad applicability beyond computer vision. Furthermore, this method addresses a fundamental bottleneck in deploying sophisticated artificial intelligence systems in bandwidth-constrained environments without compromising model performance."}

For instance, after learning to detect traffic signs, a model may later need to learn to classify traffic lights or different types of vehicles using the same camera feed. This scenario introduces a challenging setting we term Continual Multitask Learning (CMTL), where a model sequentially learns new tasks on an underlying data distribution without forgetting previously learned abilities. Existing continual learning methods often fail in this setting because they learn fragmented, task-specific features that interfere with one another. To address this, we introduce Learning with Preserving (LwP), a novel framework that shifts the focus from preserving task outputs to maintaining the geometric structure of the shared representation space. The core of LwP is a Dynamically Weighted Distance Preservation (DWDP) loss that prevents representation drift by regularizing the pairwise distances between latent data representations. This mechanism of preserving the underlying geometric structure allows the model to retain implicit knowledge and support diverse tasks without requiring a replay buffer, making it suitable for privacy-conscious applications. Extensive evaluations on time-series and image benchmarks show that LwP not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CMTL tasks. Notably, our method shows superior robustness to distribution shifts and is the only approach to surpass the strong single-task learning baseline, underscoring its effectiveness for real-world dynamic environments."}

However, the conventional numerical algorithm requires landmark conditioning, and cannot be applied into gradient-based optimization. We propose a neural surrogate, the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), that embeds LSQC energy into a multiscale mesh-spectral architecture. Next, we propose the SBN guided optimization framework SBN-Opt which optimizes free-boundary diffeomorphism for the problem, with local geometric distortion explicitly controllable. Extensive experiments on density-equalizing maps and inconsistent surface registration demonstrate our SBN-Opt's superiority over traditional numerical algorithms."}

This study aims to develop a comprehensive wildfire risk map for California by applying the random forest (RF) algorithm, augmented with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to interpret model predictions. Model performance was assessed using both spatial and temporal validation strategies. The RF model demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving near-perfect discrimination for grasslands (AUC = 0.996) and forests (AUC = 0.997). Spatial cross-validation revealed moderate transferability, yielding ROC-AUC values of 0.6155 for forests and 0.5416 for grasslands. In contrast, temporal split validation showed enhanced generalization, especially for forests (ROC-AUC = 0.6615, PR-AUC = 0.8423). SHAP-based XAI analysis identified key ecosystem-specific drivers: soil organic carbon, tree cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) emerged as the most influential in forests, whereas Land Surface Temperature (LST), elevation, and vegetation health indices were dominant in grasslands. District-level classification revealed that Central Valley and Northern Buttes districts had the highest concentration of high-risk grasslands, while Northern Buttes and North Coast Redwoods dominated forested high-risk areas. This RF-SHAP framework offers a robust, comprehensible, and adaptable method for assessing wildfire risks, enabling informed decisions and creating targeted strategies to mitigate dangers."}

To address these challenges, we propose MPCM-Net, a Multi-scale network that integrates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the encoder incorporates MPAC, which comprises:(1)a MPC block with ParCM and ParSM that enables global spatial interaction across multi-scale cloud formations, and (2)a MPA block combining ParAM and ParSM to extract discriminative features with reduced computational complexity. On the decoder side, a M2B is employed to mitigate contextual loss through a SSHD that maintains linear complexity while enabling deep feature aggregation across spatial and scale dimensions. As a key contribution to the community, we also introduce and release a dataset CSRC, which is a clear-label, fine-grained segmentation benchmark designed to overcome the critical limitations of existing public datasets. Extensive experiments on CSRC demonstrate the superior performance of MPCM-Net over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed.

A powerful training-free strategy to accelerate this process is Schedule Optimization, which aims to find an optimal distribution of timesteps for a fixed and small Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to maximize sample quality. To this end, a successful schedule optimization method must adhere to four core principles: effectiveness, adaptivity, practical robustness, and computational efficiency. However, existing paradigms struggle to satisfy these principles simultaneously, motivating the need for a more advanced solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical-Schedule-Optimizer (HSO), a novel and efficient bi-level optimization framework. HSO reframes the search for a globally optimal schedule into a more tractable problem by iteratively alternating between two synergistic levels: an upper-level global search for an optimal initialization strategy and a lower-level local optimization for schedule refinement. This process is guided by two key innovations: the Midpoint Error Proxy (MEP), a solver-agnostic and numerically stable objective for effective local optimization, and the Spacing-Penalized Fitness (SPF) function, which ensures practical robustness by penalizing pathologically close timesteps. Extensive experiments show that HSO sets a new state-of-the-art for training-free sampling in the extremely low-NFE regime. For instance, with an NFE of just 5, HSO achieves a remarkable FID of 11.94 on LAION-Aesthetics with Stable Diffusion v2.1. Crucially, this level of performance is attained not through costly retraining, but with a one-time optimization cost of less than 8 seconds, presenting a highly practical and efficient paradigm for diffusion model acceleration."}

However, tuning the learnable prompts solely based on unlabeled test data may induce prompt optimization bias, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we analyze the underlying causes of prompt optimization bias from both the model and data perspectives. In terms of the model, the entropy minimization objective typically focuses on reducing the entropy of model predictions while overlooking their correctness. This can result in overconfident yet incorrect outputs, thereby compromising the quality of prompt optimization. On the data side, prompts affected by optimization bias can introduce misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which further aggravates the prompt optimization bias. To this end, we propose a Doubly Debiased Test-Time Prompt Tuning method. Specifically, we first introduce a dynamic retrieval-augmented modulation module that retrieves high-confidence knowledge from a dynamic knowledge base using the test image feature as a query, and uses the retrieved knowledge to modulate the predictions. Guided by the refined predictions, we further develop a reliability-aware prompt optimization module that incorporates a confidence-based weighted ensemble and cross-modal consistency distillation to impose regularization constraints during prompt tuning. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmark datasets involving both natural distribution shifts and cross-datasets generalization demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, validating its effectiveness in mitigating prompt optimization bias."}

As such, we reformulate text-to-3D optimization as mapping a dynamically evolving source distribution to a fixed target distribution. We cast the problem into a dual-conditioned latent space, conditioned on both the text prompt and the intermediately rendered image. Given this joint setup, we observe that the image condition naturally anchors the current source distribution. Building on this insight, we introduce AnchorDS, an improved score distillation mechanism that provides state-anchored guidance with image conditions and stabilizes generation. We further penalize erroneous source estimates and design a lightweight filter strategy and fine-tuning strategy that refines the anchor with negligible overhead. AnchorDS produces finer-grained detail, more natural colours, and stronger semantic consistency, particularly for complex prompts, while maintaining efficiency.

Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings."}

These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes.

Motion capture (MoCap) systems are frequently used to generate ground truth annotations for human poses when training models with data from wearable or ambient sensors, and have been shown to be effective to synthesize data in these modalities. However, the representation of older adults, an increasingly important demographic in healthcare, in existing MoCap locomotion datasets has not been thoroughly examined. This work surveyed 41 publicly available datasets, identifying eight that include older adult motions and four that contain motions performed by younger actors annotated as old style. Older adults represent a small portion of participants overall, and few datasets provide full-body motion data for this group. To assess the fidelity of old-style walking motions, quantitative metrics are introduced, defining high fidelity as the ability to capture age-related differences relative to normative walking. Using gait parameters that are age-sensitive, robust to noise, and resilient to data scarcity, we found that old-style walking motions often exhibit overly controlled patterns and fail to faithfully characterize aging. These findings highlight the need for improved representation of older adults in motion datasets and establish a method to quantitatively evaluate the quality of old-style walking motions."}

Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and achieve up to 20,000x speedup (hundreds of milliseconds vs. hours). This fast and accurate estimation of hot spots and temperature distribution enables real-time cooling control and workload redistribution, leading to substantial energy savings (7\\%) and reduced carbon footprint."}

However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception.

While Eddy Covariance (EC) towers provide high-frequency estimates, their limited spatial coverage constrains large-scale assessments. Remote sensing offers a scalable alternative, yet most approaches rely on single-sensor spectral indices and statistical models that are often unable to capture the complex temporal dynamics of GPP. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) and data fusion offer new opportunities to better represent the temporal dynamics of vegetation processes, but comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art DL models for multimodal GPP prediction remain scarce. Here, we explore the performance of two representative models for predicting GPP: 1) GPT-2, a transformer architecture, and 2) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network, using multivariate inputs. Overall, both achieve similar accuracy. But, while LSTM performs better overall, GPT-2 excels during extreme events. Analysis of temporal context length further reveals that LSTM attains similar accuracy using substantially shorter input windows than GPT-2, highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off between the two architectures. Feature importance analysis reveals radiation as the dominant predictor, followed by Sentinel-2, MODIS land surface temperature, and Sentinel-1 contributions. Our results demonstrate how model architecture, context length, and multimodal inputs jointly determine performance in GPP prediction, guiding future developments of DL frameworks for monitoring terrestrial carbon dynamics."}

To address this, we introduce SAMOSA, a novel on-device system that renders spatially accurate sound by dynamically adapting to its physical environment. SAMOSA leverages a synergistic multimodal scene representation by fusing real-time estimations of room geometry, surface materials, and semantic-driven acoustic context. This rich representation then enables efficient acoustic calibration via scene priors, allowing the system to synthesize a highly realistic Room Impulse Response (RIR). We validate our system through technical evaluation using acoustic metrics for RIR synthesis across various room configurations and sound types, alongside an expert evaluation (N=12).

Using a multiple-comparison-controlled, rank-based pipeline (Friedman test with Conover-Holm post-hoc) and Bron-Kerbosch cliques, we find that the learned feature space largely determines OOD efficacy. For both CNNs and ViTs, probabilistic scores (e.g., MSR, GEN) dominate misclassification (ID) detection. Under stronger shifts, geometry-aware scores (e.g., NNGuide, fDBD, CTM) prevail on CNNs, whereas on ViTs GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error remain consistently competitive. We further show a class-count-dependent trade-off for Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD) and that a simple PCA projection improves several detectors.

The resulting mask is then used to create a region of interest around the nodule, and this localised image is fed directly into a ResNet-18 classifier. We evaluated our framework using 5-fold cross-validation on a clinical dataset of 349 images, where it achieved a high F1-score of 0.852 for predicting malignancy.

This work questions whether such complexity is necessary and constructs stealthy \"weak\" triggers -- imperceptible perturbations that have negligible adversarial effect. We propose BackWeak, a simple, surrogate-free attack paradigm. BackWeak shows that a powerful backdoor can be implanted by simply fine-tuning a benign teacher with a weak trigger using a very small learning rate. We demonstrate that this delicate fine-tuning is sufficient to embed a backdoor that reliably transfers to diverse student architectures during a victim's standard distillation process, yielding high attack success rates.

One major issue is that differences in action tokenizers across VLA architectures hinder reproducibility and fair comparison. More importantly, most existing attacks have not been validated in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose AttackVLA, a unified framework that aligns with the VLA development lifecycle, covering data construction, model training, and inference. Within this framework, we implement a broad suite of attacks, including all existing attacks targeting VLAs and multiple adapted attacks originally developed for vision-language models, and evaluate them in both simulation and real-world settings. Our analysis of existing attacks reveals a critical gap: current methods tend to induce untargeted failures or static action states, leaving targeted attacks that drive VLAs to perform precise long-horizon action sequences largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce BackdoorVLA, a targeted backdoor attack that compels a VLA to execute an attacker-specified long-horizon action sequence whenever a trigger is present.

The performance of denoising is assessed with two metrics: the standard Structural Similarity Index SSIMImg of restored and clean images and a newly applied metric SSIMMap - the SSIM of entropy maps of these images computed via 2D Sample Entropy in sliding windows. We shown that SSIMMap is more sensitive to blur and local intensity transitions and complements SSIMImg. Experiments on low- and high-resolution grayscales images demonstrate that recursive threshold MF robustly restores images even under strong noise (50-60 %), whereas simple AE is only capable of restoring images with low levels of noise (<30 %). We propose two scalable schemes: (i) 2MF, which uses two MFs with different window sizes and a final thresholding step, effective for highlighting sharp local details at low resolution; and (ii) MFs-AE, which aggregates features from multiple MFs via an AE and is beneficial for restoring the overall scene structure at higher resolution. Owing to its simplicity and computational efficiency, MF remains preferable for deployment on resource-constrained platforms (edge/IoT), whereas AE underperforms without prior denoising. The results also validate the practical value of SSIMMap for objective blur assessment and denoising parameter tuning."}

Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition. This work demonstrates a novel pathway for developing privacy-preserving, reproducible patient safety monitoring systems with potential for deployment in intensive care settings."}

To address the challenges posed by the Poisson likelihood -- such as non-Lipschitz gradients and positivity constraints -- we derive a Bayesian model which leverages exact and asymptotically exact data augmentations. In particular, the augmented model incorporates two sets of splitting variables both derived through a Bregman divergence based on the Burg entropy. Interestingly the resulting augmented posterior distribution is characterized by conditional distributions which benefit from natural conjugacy properties and preserve the intrinsic geometry of the latent and splitting variables. This allows for efficient sampling via Gibbs steps, which can be performed explicitly for all conditionals, except the one incorporating the regularization potential. For this latter, we resort to a Hessian Riemannian Langevin Monte Carlo (HRLMC) algorithm which is well suited to handle priors with explicit or easily computable score functions. By operating on a mirror manifold, this Langevin step ensures that the sampling satisfies the positivity constraints and more accurately reflects the underlying problem structure. Performance results obtained on denoising, deblurring, and positron emission tomography (PET) experiments demonstrate that the method achieves competitive performance in terms of reconstruction quality compared to optimization- and sampling-based approaches."}

In this work, we propose MTMed3D, a novel end-to-end Multi-task Transformer-based model to address the limitations of single-task models by jointly performing 3D detection, segmentation, and classification in medical imaging.

An effective visual system therefore needs unified scene representations that relate scene parts to their location and their co-occurrence. We hypothesize that this structure can be learned self-supervised from natural experience by exploiting the temporal regularities of active vision: each fixation reveals a locally-detailed glimpse that is statistically related to the previous one via co-occurrence and saccade-conditioned spatial regularities. We instantiate this idea with Glimpse Prediction Networks (GPNs) -- recurrent models trained to predict the feature embedding of the next glimpse along human-like scanpaths over natural scenes. GPNs successfully learn co-occurrence structure and, when given relative saccade location vectors, show sensitivity to spatial arrangement. Furthermore, recurrent variants of GPNs were able to integrate information across glimpses into a unified scene representation. Notably, these scene representations align strongly with human fMRI responses during natural-scene viewing across mid/high-level visual cortex. Critically, GPNs outperform architecture- and dataset-matched controls trained with explicit semantic objectives, and match or exceed strong modern vision baselines, leaving little unique variance for those alternatives. These results establish next-glimpse prediction during active vision as a biologically plausible, self-supervised route to brain-aligned scene representations learned from natural visual experience."}

In X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to filter the projection data but are ill-suited for this task as they apply grid-based convolutions to the sinogram, which inherently lies on a line manifold, not a regular grid. The CNNs, unaware of the geometry, are implicitly tied to it and require an excessive amount of parameters as they must infer the relations between measurements from the data rather than from prior information.\n  The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a graph data structure to represent CT acquisition geometries and tomographic data, providing a detailed explanation of the graph's structure for circular, cone-beam geometries. Second, we propose GLM, a hybrid neural network architecture that leverages both graph and grid convolutions to process tomographic data.\n  We demonstrate that GLM outperforms CNNs when performance is quantified in terms of structural similarity and peak signal-to-noise ratio, despite the fact that GLM uses only a fraction of the trainable parameters.

As tumors expand, they induce substantial anatomical deformation that disrupts both local tissue organization and global brain architecture, complicating diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. Yet a subject-specific reference of how the brain would appear without tumor-induced changes is fundamentally unobtainable in clinical practice. We present BrainNormalizer, an anatomy-informed diffusion framework that reconstructs pseudo-healthy MRIs directly from tumorous scans by conditioning the generative process on boundary cues extracted from the subject's own anatomy. This boundary-guided conditioning enables anatomically plausible pseudo-healthy reconstruction without requiring paired non-tumorous and tumorous scans. BrainNormalizer employs a two-stage training strategy. The pretrained diffusion model is first adapted through inpainting-based fine-tuning on tumorous and non-tumorous scans. Next, an edge-map-guided ControlNet branch is trained to inject fine-grained anatomical contours into the frozen decoder while preserving learned priors. During inference, a deliberate misalignment strategy pairs tumorous inputs with non-tumorous prompts and mirrored contralateral edge maps, leveraging hemispheric correspondence to guide reconstruction. On the BraTS2020 dataset, BrainNormalizer achieves strong quantitative performance and qualitatively produces anatomically plausible reconstructions in tumor-affected regions while retaining overall structural coherence. BrainNormalizer provides clinically reliable anatomical references for treatment planning and supports new research directions in counterfactual modeling and tumor-induced deformation analysis."}

By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x).

Many learning-based and model-based methods exist that estimate event-based optical flow, however the temporally dense yet spatially sparse nature of events poses significant challenges. To address these issues, contrast maximization (CM) is a prominent model-based optimization methodology that estimates the motion trajectories of events within an event volume by optimally warping them. Since its introduction, the CM framework has undergone a series of refinements by the computer vision community. Nonetheless, it remains a highly non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel biologically-inspired hybrid CM method for event-based optical flow estimation that couples visual and inertial motion cues. Concretely, we propose the use of orientation maps, derived from camera 3D velocities, as priors to guide the CM process. The orientation maps provide directional guidance and constrain the space of estimated motion trajectories. We show that this orientation-guided formulation leads to improved robustness and convergence in event-based optical flow estimation. The evaluation of our approach on the MVSEC, DSEC, and ECD datasets yields superior accuracy scores over the state of the art."}

Such cross-modal couplings can produce unsafe semantics even when individual inputs are benign, exposing the fragile safety awareness of current MLLMs. While recent works enhance safety by guiding models to reason about potential risks, unregulated reasoning traces may compromise alignment; although Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offers self-rewarded refinement without human supervision, it lacks verifiable signals for reasoning safety. To address this, we propose SafeGRPO a self-rewarded multimodal safety alignment framework that integrates rule-governed reward construction into GRPO, enabling interpretable and verifiable optimization of reasoning safety. Built upon the constructed SafeTag-VL-3K dataset with explicit visual, textual, and combined safety tags, SafeGRPO performs step-guided safety thinking to enforce structured reasoning and behavior alignment, substantially improving multimodal safety awareness, compositional robustness, and reasoning stability across diverse benchmarks without sacrificing general capabilities."}

Existing methods such as FGSM and PGD apply perturbations without regard to the underlying hyperbolic structure, potentially leading to inefficient or geometrically inconsistent attacks. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack that explicitly leverages the geometric properties of hyperbolic space. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the loss function in the tangent space of hyperbolic space, decompose it into a radial (depth) component and an angular (semantic) component, and apply perturbation derived solely from the angular direction. Our method generates adversarial examples by focusing perturbations in semantically sensitive directions encoded in angular movement within the hyperbolic geometry. Empirical results on image classification, cross-modal retrieval tasks and network architectures demonstrate that our attack achieves higher fooling rates than conventional adversarial attacks, while producing high-impact perturbations with deeper insights into vulnerabilities of hyperbolic embeddings. This work highlights the importance of geometry-aware adversarial strategies in curved representation spaces and provides a principled framework for attacking hierarchical embeddings."}

This is the extended version, including the technical appendix", "summary": "Precise estimation and uncertainty quantification for average crop yields are critical for agricultural monitoring and decision making. Existing data collection methods, such as crop cuts in randomly sampled fields at harvest time, are relatively time-consuming. Thus, we propose an approach based on prediction-powered inference (PPI) to supplement these crop cuts with less time-consuming field photos. After training a computer vision model to predict the ground truth crop cut yields from the photos, we learn a ``control function\" that recalibrates these predictions with the spatial coordinates of each field. This enables fields with photos but not crop cuts to be leveraged to improve the precision of zone-wide average yield estimates. Our control function is learned by training on a dataset of nearly 20,000 real crop cuts and photos of rice and maize fields in sub-Saharan Africa. To improve precision, we pool training observations across different zones within the same first-level subdivision of each country. Our final PPI-based point estimates of the average yield are provably asymptotically unbiased and cannot increase the asymptotic variance beyond that of the natural baseline estimator -- the sample average of the crop cuts -- as the number of fields grows. We also propose a novel bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap to construct accompanying confidence intervals. Even in zones with as few as 20 fields, the point estimates show significant empirical improvement over the baseline, increasing the effective sample size by as much as 73% for rice and by 12-23% for maize. The confidence intervals are accordingly shorter at minimal cost to empirical finite-sample coverage. This demonstrates the potential for relatively low-cost images to make area-based crop insurance more affordable and thus spur investment into sustainable agricultural practices."}

Our method combines 3D Gaussians with learnable reflection planes that explicitly model the glass planes with view-dependent reflectance strengths. Real scenes and transmission components are modeled by 3D Gaussians and the reflection components are modeled by the mirrored Gaussians with respect to the reflection plane. The transmission and reflection components are blended according to a Fresnel-based, view-dependent weighting scheme, allowing for faithful synthesis of complex appearance effects under varying viewpoints. To effectively optimize TR-Gaussians, we develop a multi-stage optimization framework incorporating color and geometry constraints and an opacity perturbation mechanism. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that TR-Gaussians achieve real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis in scenes with planar transmission and reflection, and outperform state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively."}

While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis."}

We use a large Visual-Language Model (VLM), named PIGEON-VL, to select Points of Interest (PoI) formed during exploration and then employ a lower-level planner for action output, increasing the decision frequency. Additionally, this PoI-based decision-making enables the generation of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) data suitable for simulators.

Therefore, we introduce DAP, a discrete-token autoregressive planner that jointly forecasts BEV semantics and ego trajectories, thereby enforcing comprehensive representation learning and allowing predicted dynamics to directly condition ego motion. In addition, we incorporate a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning, which preserves supervised behavior cloning priors while injecting reward-guided improvements. Despite a compact 160M parameter budget, DAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-loop metrics and delivers competitive closed-loop results on the NAVSIM benchmark. Overall, the fully discrete-token autoregressive formulation operating on both rasterized BEV and ego actions provides a compact yet scalable planning paradigm for autonomous driving."}

Recent advances use screenshot-based document encoding with fine-grained late interaction, significantly improving retrieval performance. However, retrievers are still trained with coarse global relevance labels, without revealing which regions support the match. As a result, retrievers tend to rely on surface-level cues and struggle to capture implicit semantic connections, hindering their ability to handle non-extractive queries. To alleviate this problem, we propose a \\textbf{A}ttention-\\textbf{G}rounded \\textbf{RE}triever \\textbf{E}nhancement (AGREE) framework. AGREE leverages cross-modal attention from multimodal large language models as proxy local supervision to guide the identification of relevant document regions. During training, AGREE combines local signals with the global signals to jointly optimize the retriever, enabling it to learn not only whether documents match, but also which content drives relevance. Experiments on the challenging ViDoRe V2 benchmark show that AGREE significantly outperforms the global-supervision-only baseline. Quantitative and qualitative analyses further demonstrate that AGREE promotes deeper alignment between query terms and document regions, moving beyond surface-level matching toward more accurate and interpretable retrieval.

Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks.

In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience."}
