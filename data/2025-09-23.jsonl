The dataset is constructed by filtering\nCommon Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million\ndocuments, the filtering process is used to arrive at a final dataset of\nroughly 55k documents that have over 450k pages. Analysis shows that the\ndataset contains a diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the\npages are non-English, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up\nmore than 25% of the dataset.\n  In addition, this paper presents a family of form field detectors,\nFFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain a very high average precision on\nthe CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation\nresults show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for high-quality form\nfield detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over\nusing all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. A qualitative\nanalysis shows that they outperform a popular, commercially available PDF\nreader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available\nsolutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature\nfields. This is, to our knowledge, the first large scale dataset released for\nform field detection, as well as the first open source models.

Prior work aims to mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting\nsparsity in the attention layers to reduce computation. However, these works\ntypically rely on block-sparse attention, which skips score computation only\nwhen all entries in a block of attention scores (corresponding to M queries and\nM keys, with M = 64 typically) are zero. This coarse-granular skipping of\nattention scores does not fully exploit sparsity in the attention map and\nleaves room for improvement. In this work, we propose FG-Attn, a sparse\nattention mechanism for long-context diffusion transformers that leverages\nsparsity at a fine granularity. Unlike block-sparse attention, which skips\nentire MxM blocks, our approach skips computations at the granularity of Mx1\nslices of the attention map. Each slice is produced by query-key dot products\nbetween a block of query vectors and a single key. To implement our proposed\nsparse attention mechanism, we develop a new efficient bulk-load operation\ncalled asynchronous-gather load.

Only a sparse set of keys relevant to those queries\nare loaded into shared memory when computing attention for a block of queries,\nin contrast to loading full blocks of key tokens in block-sparse attention.

To address these challenges, we propose a chromaticity-intensity\ndecomposition framework, which disentangles an HSI into a spatially smooth\nintensity map and a spectrally variant chromaticity cube. The chromaticity\nencodes lighting-invariant reflectance, enriched with high-frequency spatial\ndetails and local spectral sparsity.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose Diff-GNSS, a coarse-to-fine GNSS measurement\n(pseudorange) error estimation framework that leverages a conditional diffusion\nmodel to capture such complex distributions. Firstly, a Mamba-based module\nperforms coarse estimation to provide an initial prediction with appropriate\nscale and trend. Then, a conditional denoising diffusion layer refines the\nestimate, enabling fine-grained modeling of pseudorange errors. To suppress\nuncontrolled generative diversity and achieve controllable synthesis, three key\nfeatures related to GNSS measurement quality are used as conditions to\nprecisely guide the reverse denoising process. We further incorporate\nper-satellite uncertainty modeling within the diffusion stage to assess the\nreliability of the predicted errors. We have collected and publicly released a\nreal-world dataset covering various scenes. Experiments on public and\nself-collected datasets show that DiffGNSS consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models to pseudorange\nerror estimation. The proposed diffusion-based refinement module is\nplug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing networks to markedly\nimprove estimation accuracy."}

Monocular video offers an attractive\ninput format due to its simplicity and scalability; however, it's challenging\nto disentangle the object geometry and part dynamics with visual supervision\nalone, as the joint movement of the camera and parts leads to ill-posed\nestimation.

This paper\npresents a novel approach that reframes needle localization as a tip-handle\ndetection and matching problem to overcome these difficulties. An anchor-free\nnetwork, based on HRNet, is proposed to extract multi-scale features and\naccurately detect needle tips and handles by predicting their centers and\norientations using decoupled branches for heatmap regression and polar angle\nprediction. To associate detected tips and handles into individual needles, a\ngreedy matching and merging (GMM) method designed to solve the unbalanced\nassignment problem with constraints (UAP-C) is presented. The GMM method\niteratively selects the most probable tip-handle pairs and merges them based on\na distance metric to reconstruct 3D needle paths. Evaluated on a dataset of 100\npatients, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance, achieving\nhigher precision and F1 score compared to a segmentation-based method utilizing\nthe nnUNet model,thereby offering a more robust and accurate solution for\nneedle localization in complex clinical scenarios."}

With the increasing availability of open vector map annotations,\ne.g., OpenStreetMap, utilizing historical labels for off-nadir image annotation\nhas become viable because remote sensing images are georeferenced once\ncaptured. However, these historical labels commonly suffer from significant\npositional discrepancies with new images and only have one annotation (roof or\nfootprint), which fails to describe the correct structures of a building.

This is especially true at high resolutions\nwhere neural UDFs exhibit higher noise levels, which makes it hard to capture\nfine details. Most current techniques perform within single voxels without\nreference to their neighborhood, resulting in missing surface and holes where\nthe UDF is ambiguous or noisy. We show that this can be remedied by performing\nseveral passes and by reasoning on previously extracted surface elements to\nincorporate neighborhood information. Our key contribution is an iterative\nneural network that does this and progressively improves surface recovery\nwithin each voxel by spatially propagating information from increasingly\ndistant neighbors. Unlike single-pass methods, our approach integrates newly\ndetected surfaces, distance values, and gradients across multiple iterations,\neffectively correcting errors and stabilizing extraction in challenging\nregions. Experiments on diverse 3D models demonstrate that our method produces\nsignificantly more accurate and complete meshes than existing approaches,\nparticularly for complex geometries, enabling UDF surface extraction at higher\nresolutions where traditional methods fail."}
