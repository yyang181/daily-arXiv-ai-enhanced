State-Change Counterfactuals for Procedure-Aware Video Representation Learning", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": "4 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables. Full paper is available at\n  arXiv:2503.21055", "summary": "Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps\ntransform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the\nsequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Yet,\nexisting work on procedure-aware video representations fails to explicitly\nlearned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study\nprocedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change\ndescriptions generated by LLMs as supervision signals for video encoders.\nMoreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized\nfailure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if''\nscenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to\nunderstand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the\nprocedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on\nprocedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection,\nand more. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nstate-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant\nimprovements on multiple tasks."}

Nevertheless,existing methods struggle to unify these\ncapabilities due to their fundamental differences.In this paper, we present the\nVisual Embodied Brain (VeBrain), a unified framework for perception, reasoning,\nand control in real world. VeBrain reformulates robotic control into common\ntext-based MLLM tasks in the 2D visual space, thus unifying the objectives and\nmapping spaces of different tasks. Then, a novel robotic adapter is proposed to\nconvert textual control signals from MLLMs to motion policies of real robots.\nFrom the data perspective, we further introduce VeBrain-600k, a high-quality\ninstruction dataset encompassing various capabilities of VeBrain. In\nVeBrain-600k, we take hundreds of hours to collect, curate and annotate the\ndata, and adopt multimodal chain-of-thought(CoT) to mix the different\ncapabilities into a single conversation. Extensive experiments on 13 multimodal\nbenchmarks and 5 spatial intelligence benchmarks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of VeBrain to existing MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL.

On the other hand, BAGNet\nemploys a lightweight attention pooling layer to extract the global feature of\nthe point cloud to maintain model accuracy.

To address these limitations, we\nintroduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training\nopen-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian\nSplatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation\nwithout the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals\nfrom open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model\nfor dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at\ninference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate\nWoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization\ntasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and\ndiffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves\nstrong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot."}

Many dataset paper submissions\nlack originality, diversity, or rigorous quality control, and these\nshortcomings are often overlooked during peer review. Submissions also\nfrequently omit essential details about dataset construction and properties.\nWhile existing tools such as datasheets aim to promote transparency, they are\nlargely descriptive and do not provide standardized, measurable methods for\nevaluating data quality. Similarly, metadata requirements at conferences\npromote accountability but are inconsistently enforced. To address these\nlimitations, this position paper advocates for the integration of systematic,\nrubric-based evaluation metrics into the dataset review process-particularly as\nsubmission volumes continue to grow. We also explore scalable, cost-effective\nmethods for synthetic data generation, including dedicated tools and\nLLM-as-a-judge approaches, to support more efficient evaluation. As a call to\naction, we introduce DataRubrics, a structured framework for assessing the\nquality of both human- and model-generated datasets. Leveraging recent advances\nin LLM-based evaluation, DataRubrics offers a reproducible, scalable, and\nactionable solution for dataset quality assessment, enabling both authors and\nreviewers to uphold higher standards in data-centric research.

Despite recent advancements, existing models,\nespecially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to\ngeneralize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve\nstrong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of\nextending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models,\nwhere an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and\nlanguage data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does\nmodality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging\neffectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to\nachieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better\nknowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through\nextensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into\nthe feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches."}

However, they often fail to produce\nsemantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations\nthat contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual\ncontradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled\nassociations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware\nprompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a\nsequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the\nsemantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while\nensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a\nlarge language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify\ncontradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original\nintent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information\nwith the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic\ncontrol and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual\ncontradictions. Experiments across a variety of challenging prompts show\nsubstantial improvements in alignment to the textual prompt."}
