In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based\npriors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through\nan empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two\nkey properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,\nthe landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural\nimages.

Leveraging a\nmonocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost\nalternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core\nchallenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,\ncomplicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB\nappearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;\nand (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic\nLiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and\nLiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional\ndiffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism\n(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and\ndepth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal\nAlignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a\nPanoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency\nacross monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two\nmetrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to\nevaluate alignment quality across modalities.

Additionally, their\nhigh computational demand and extended processing time hinder their practical\nuse in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we introduce a\nGlobal-Local Latent Consistency Model (GL-LCM) architecture. This model\ncombines lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion,\nenabling fast high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images. To tackle\npotential boundary artifacts and detail blurring in local-path sampling, we\nfurther propose Local-Enhanced Guidance, which addresses these issues without\nadditional training. Comprehensive experiments on a self-collected dataset\nSZCH-X-Rays, and the public dataset JSRT, reveal that our GL-LCM delivers\nsuperior bone suppression and remarkable computational efficiency,\nsignificantly outperforming several competitive methods.

We investigate whether MRI provides additional\npredictive value for ED at 12 months post-surgery, evaluating four modeling\nstrategies: (1) a clinical-only baseline, representing current\nstate-of-the-art; (2) classical models using handcrafted anatomical features\nderived from MRI; (3) deep learning models trained directly on MRI slices; and\n(4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs. Imaging-based models\n(maximum AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches\n(AUC 0.554) but fell short of the clinical baseline (AUC 0.663). Fusion models\noffered marginal gains (AUC 0.586) but did not exceed clinical-only\nperformance. SHAP analysis confirmed that clinical features contributed most to\npredictive performance. Saliency maps from the best-performing imaging model\nsuggested a predominant focus on anatomically plausible regions, such as the\nprostate and neurovascular bundles.

Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers\na promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is\nmodeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to\ndisease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly\ndetection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and\ngenerate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration;\ndifferences between the original and restored images highlight potential\nabnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model\napproaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important\ncontext to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard\napproaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor\nreconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the\nfirst conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide\nthe healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting\nstrategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific\nfeatures. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans,\nwhich may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities\nin heterogeneous cohorts."}

Project website: https://double-bench.github.io/", "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their\ndevelopment is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks\noften focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with\nincomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect\nreal-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal\nevaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each\ncomponent within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880\npages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4\ndocument types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data\ncontamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence\npages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.\nOur comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4\nMLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text\nand visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building\nstronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the\nover-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to\nprovide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source\nDouble-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced\ndocument RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new\nbenchmarks on an annual basis."}

The long denoising sequence for each action prediction\nimpedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require\nmillions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical\nfine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion\npolicies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong\ndependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for\nfine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement\nlearning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment\ninteractions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective\nadaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline\nplay interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,\nmaking the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot\nlearning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across\neight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude\nfewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this\nis the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world\nrobotic skills using an offline world model.
