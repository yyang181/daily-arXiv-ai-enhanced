To make this approach\npossible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a\nwarehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has\nlimitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is\nnecessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19\nwide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the\nlogistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera\ncoordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment\nbased on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle\ncameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly\nin the vertical direction.

Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables\nresearch into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized\nsubsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential\nediting, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a\n56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;\nand (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction\nrewriting and summarization capabilities.
