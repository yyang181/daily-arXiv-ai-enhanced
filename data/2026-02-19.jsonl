We introduce FlipSet, a diagnostic benchmark for Level-2 visual perspective taking (L2 VPT) in vision-language models. The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Control experiments expose a compositional deficit--models achieve high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, yet fail catastrophically when integration is required. This dissociation indicates that current VLMs lack the mechanisms needed to bind social awareness to spatial operations, suggesting fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning. FlipSet provides a cognitively grounded testbed for diagnosing perspective-taking capabilities in multimodal systems."}

However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\\% and 4.02\\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components. While the reliance on a large vision-language model entails higher computational cost, our work presents a significant step towards more generalizable and robust deepfake detection."}

LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures. Recent research prioritizes real-time inference and cross-sensor generalization for practical deployment. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future research directions for advancing LiDAR super-resolution technology."}

However, retrieved knowledge is often noisy, partially irrelevant, or misaligned with the visual content, while internal model knowledge is difficult to control and interpret. Naive aggregation of these sources limits reasoning effectiveness and reduces answer accuracy. To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization."}

However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons.

However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway. Each model exhibits a distinct failure mode in the squares condition -- systematic under-counting (Claude), massive over-counting (ChatGPT), and template hallucination (Gemini) -- but all share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization for non-textual visual elements."}

The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.\n  To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients.\n  Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm. Without explicit region-of-interest extraction, the model consistently attends to pulse-rich areas and demonstrates robustness under clinical occlusions and noise."}

Despite the meteoric rise in the number of neuromorphic datasets published over the past ten years, the conclusion of a significant portion of neuromorphic research papers still states that there is a need for yet more data and even larger datasets.

This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data. This paper also highlights the growth in the size of individual datasets and the complexities involved in working with the data. However, a more important concern is the rise of synthetic datasets, created by either simulation or video-to-events methods. This review explores the benefits of simulated data for testing existing algorithms and applications, highlighting the potential pitfalls for exploring new applications of neuromorphic technologies. This review also introduces the concepts of meta-datasets, created from existing datasets, as a way of both reducing the need for more data, and to remove potential bias arising from defining both the dataset and the task."}

Unlike existing approaches that rely on large general-purpose or fine-tuned vision-language models for both image interpretation and report composition, BTReport performs deterministic feature extraction for image analysis and uses large language models only for syntactic structuring and narrative formatting. By separating RRG into a deterministic feature extraction step and a report generation step, the generated reports are completely interpretable and less prone to hallucinations. We show that the features used for report generation are predictive of key clinical outcomes, including survival and IDH mutation status, and reports generated by BTReport are more closely aligned with reference clinical reports than existing baselines for RRG.

MedProbCLIP models image and text representations as Gaussian embeddings through a probabilistic contrastive objective that explicitly captures uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences between radiographs and clinical narratives.

Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.\n  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.\n  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization. At 16K codebook size, LGQ improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate, achieving comparable fidelity with substantially fewer active entries.

Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation.

We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions.

Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users."}

In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks.

Alternatively, we explore fine-tuning an existing OCR model, despite not being trained for the target languages.

Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing. Our work also highlights VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism, offering a promising new direction for enhancing accuracy on a wide range of vision-centric tasks."}

Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack."}

Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with good efficiency."}

However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics."}

Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained."}

While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \\emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning."}

However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\\times$ faster encoding speeds.

In contrast, humans plan using maps: we reason globally first, then act locally. We introduce ReasonNavi, a human-inspired framework that operationalizes this reason-then-act paradigm by coupling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with deterministic planners. ReasonNavi converts a top-down map into a discrete reasoning space by room segmentation and candidate target nodes sampling. An MLLM is then queried in a multi-stage process to identify the candidate most consistent with the instruction (object, image, or text goal), effectively leveraging the model's semantic reasoning ability while sidestepping its weakness in continuous coordinate prediction. The selected waypoint is grounded into executable trajectories using a deterministic action planner over an online-built occupancy map, while pretrained object detectors and segmenters ensure robust recognition at the goal. This yields a unified zero-shot navigation framework that requires no MLLM fine-tuning, circumvents the brittleness of RL-based policies and scales naturally with foundation model improvements. Across three navigation tasks, ReasonNavi consistently outperforms prior methods that demand extensive training or heavy scene modeling, offering a scalable, interpretable, and globally grounded solution to embodied navigation.

However, all of these approaches are limited by the image captured these conditions. An alternate approach is to utilize a programmable onboard light that adds to ambient illumination and improves captured images. However, it is not straightforward to predict its impact on image formation. Illumination interacts nonlinearly with depth, surface reflectance, and scene geometry. It can both reveal structure and induce failure modes such as specular highlights and saturation. We introduce Lightning, a closed-loop illumination-control framework for visual SLAM that combines relighting, offline optimization, and imitation learning. This is performed in three stages. First, we train a Co-Located Illumination Decomposition (CLID) relighting model that decomposes a robot observation into an ambient component and a light-contribution field. CLID enables physically consistent synthesis of the same scene under alternative light intensities and thereby creates dense multi-intensity training data without requiring us to repeatedly re-run trajectories. Second, using these synthesized candidates, we formulate an offline Optimal Intensity Schedule (OIS) problem that selects illumination levels over a sequence trading off SLAM-relevant image utility against power consumption and temporal smoothness. Third, we distill this ideal solution into a real-time controller through behavior cloning, producing an Illumination Control Policy (ILC) that generalizes beyond the initial training distribution and runs online on a mobile robot to command discrete light-intensity levels. Across our evaluation, Lightning substantially improves SLAM trajectory robustness while reducing unnecessary illumination power."}

A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing."}

Equal contribution: Ahmet Halici, Ece Tugba Cebeci, Musa Balci", "summary": "Generating diagnostic text from histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is challenging due to the gigapixel scale of the input and the requirement for precise, domain specific language. We propose a hierarchical vision language framework that combines a frozen pathology foundation model with a Transformer decoder for report generation. To make WSI processing tractable, we perform multi resolution pyramidal patch selection (downsampling factors 2^3 to 2^6) and remove background and artifacts using Laplacian variance and HSV based criteria. Patch features are extracted with the UNI Vision Transformer and projected to a 6 layer Transformer decoder that generates diagnostic text via cross attention. To better represent biomedical terminology, we tokenize the output using BioGPT. Finally, we add a retrieval based verification step that compares generated reports with a reference corpus using Sentence BERT embeddings; if a high similarity match is found, the generated report is replaced with the retrieved ground truth reference to improve reliability."}

Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models."}

Among the factors that define material appearance, gloss, along with color, is widely regarded as one of the most important, and recent studies indicate that humans can perceive gloss independently of the artistic style used to depict an object. To investigate how gloss and artistic style are represented in learned models, we train an unsupervised generative model on a newly curated dataset of painterly objects designed to systematically vary such factors. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical latent space in which gloss is disentangled from other appearance factors, allowing for a detailed study of how gloss is represented and varies across artistic styles. Building on this representation, we introduce a lightweight adapter that connects our style- and gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of non-photorealistic images with fine-grained control of these factors. We compare our approach with previous models and observe improved disentanglement and controllability of the learned factors."}

Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects."}
