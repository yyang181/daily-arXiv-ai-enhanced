A key limitation of existing\nadversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation\nbudget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness\ncharacteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce\ninstance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static\napproximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon\nScheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial\nperturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates\nthree key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via\ngradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,\nand (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these\ncues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget\ndynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results\non CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both\nadversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon\nbaselines and prior adaptive methods.

Recent video\ngeneration models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of\ntransformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal\nmodeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video\nsuper-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,\nwhich can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.\nWhile recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using\nsmaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as\nrestricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,\nwhich can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these\nissues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\\times$Temporal Transformer for\nReal-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual\naxial spatial$\\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and\ntemporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need\nfor motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a\ncohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR\nachieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task."}

This work aims to\nintroduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by\nleveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to\ngenerate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using\ngeneric models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the\npoint clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach\nthat allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional\ncosts. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as\nPointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the\nmodels only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of\n91.35\\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor\nvalidated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain\nscenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed\nbetter than models trained on real-world data.

While several distillation-based\napproaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,\nextending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,\nparticularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In\nthis work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,\nwhich performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the\nchallenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several\nenhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,\nan adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is\ndynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window\ninconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a\npredefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training\ntowards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,\nincluding a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing\ntraining efficiency.

It requires interpreting\nfine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital\ntext, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In\nsuch multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on\nselectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a\nrich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally\nextended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse\nmathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.\nIt requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand\ninstructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and\ntextual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,\ntotaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,\nquestions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem\nsolving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual\ntransfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep\ninstructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended\nexplanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes\nmulti-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model\ncapabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing\napproaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must\nreason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and\nmodality-rich mathematical problem settings.

Specifically, we identify the impact of a\nkey family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call\ncross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust\nclassification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a\nsynthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model\narchitectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the\nmodel tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness\ncheckpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust\noverfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific\nfeatures. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two\nexisting properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and\nrobust overfitting.
