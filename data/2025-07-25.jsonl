In addition to the\nnormal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and\nsubsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially\nfor the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using\nan end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance\namong various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we\ndesign a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full\nuse of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the\nperformance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial\nmaterial results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a\nfinetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map\nhas different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled\nPBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be\noptimized during the training of prior models.

Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the\ntemporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the\nspatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,\nwe first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model\nthe implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and\nvideo sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that\naugments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that\nthe visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final\nexperiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further\nenhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and\nfacilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented\ncaptions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open\nsource LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when\nquantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%\nimprovement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques."}

To fill this gap, we introduce the\nGaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently\nand jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that\nis illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first\nreconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.\nBased on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse\nrendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing\nmulti-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the\nrendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.\nWe also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to\nrefine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and\nmulti-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After\noptimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,\nrelighting, and material and shape editing.

The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe\nalgorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a\nrobotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and\nthe phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate\nthat the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting\nsignificantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch\nangles.
