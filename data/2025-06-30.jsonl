First, to align\nmulti-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic\nAugmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics\nacross fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is\ndesigned to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge\ndatabase, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and\nmulti-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation\nacross multiple levels.

However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is\ngreatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key\nground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the\nextraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image\nfeature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS\nimages for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These\nchallenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and\ngenerate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning\nmulti-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes\nfrom the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class\ndisparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly\nlose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor\nsegmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked\ndeep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The\nproposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness\nlong-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual\nblocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient\nglobal dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental\nresults obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate\nthat the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in\nsemantic segmentation."}

In\ncontrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more\nnatural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains\nchallenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a\nCP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit\nneural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data\nrepresentation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of\ntensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a\nsparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p\nquasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For\nsmoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the\nJacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator.

In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting.

To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results.

Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory\nstraightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods\ntypically do not shed light on the underlying \\textit{structure} of the\ngenerative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an\ninterpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator\ntheory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of\nobservables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns\nan embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,\none-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant\nspeedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and\nreal-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face\nDataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured\nKoopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions\noffer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal\nscaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By\ncombining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow\nmatching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative\nmodeling."}

However, KANs\npotential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this\nwork, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid\nand fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt\nthe KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the\nrepresentational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we\ncombine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully\nquantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated\nto a quantum model.

Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering\nout-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as\nwidefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.\nComputational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to\ncheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off\ntells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high\nPSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.\nExisting methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or\nproduce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In\nthis work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light\nmicroscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to\nfind a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the\nrealism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the\nconditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a\nhazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on\n5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion\nand perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a\nconsistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with\ncalibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated\npredictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation\noperator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data.

The classic method relies on multiple\nexposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging\ndynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR\ndata into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many\nestablished methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image\ndetail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize\nthe global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR\nshutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the\nsensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the\nsensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.\nThe exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization\nproblem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many\nsensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest\nsaturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an\noff-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle\nis coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our\nprototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with\n48dB dynamic range."}
