However, deploying these fixed models in\nreal-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess\nheterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to\ndeploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression\nmethods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve\nefficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing\nresource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable\nand Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by\nstitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires\naddressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal\nstitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,\nand choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these\nchallenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the\nstitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers\nfrom a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To\nfacilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This\ndesign enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging\navailable resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,\nTransformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,\nallowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible\naccuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training\ncost."}

Unlike these prevailing efforts, we propose a new\nexploration-exploitation reinforcement learning framework, which explores\npolicies to fuse multi-modal information and adaptively select adequate\ndemonstrations as an integrated whole. The framework allows LVLMs to optimize\nthemselves by continually refining their demonstrations through\nself-exploration, enabling the ability to autonomously identify and generate\nthe most effective selection policies for in-context learning. Experimental\nresults verify the superior performance of our approach on four Visual\nQuestion-Answering (VQA) datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing\nthe generalization capability of few-shot LVLMs."}

To address these\nlimitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured\nand consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It\nfirst identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses\nredundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided\nDeformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation,\neliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained\ndeformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor\nresolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level\ntransformations.

ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT\nfine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2)\nreinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a\nfine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural\nintegrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter\nmodel achieves a 97\\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate,\nnode-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior\nstate-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as\nGPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the\nreasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.\nQualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows\nwith diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art\ncreation."}

To tackle this, we introduce News Media Provenance\nDataset, a dataset of news articles with provenance-tagged images.

However, current evaluations of VLAs remain\ninsufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to\nthe lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that\nincorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend\nto investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization\ncapabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies\non real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,\nwhich creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this\ngap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across\n10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We\nsystematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this\nsuite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that\nwhile VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high\nlevel planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably\ntranslate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution\nobservations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action\nexecution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's\ngeneralist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code\nto serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on\nclosing the perception-to-action gap.

Towards this end,\nwe study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image\nfrom its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with\nReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight\ndecay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this\nnon-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex\npenalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a\nsufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is\nexactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem.

To this end, we identify\nCanonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM\nfeatures preserve essential categorical information while discarding\nnon-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative\nsamples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the\ncore class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we\ndevelop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While\nthe student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers\ncore class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the\ntraining data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial\nrobustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals\ninstead of spurious background cues.

This paper explores a self-supervised approach\nthat combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data\n(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,\nand planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free\njoint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset\ncomprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong\nperformance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something\nv2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7\nrecall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.\nAdditionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering\ntasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on\nTempCompass).

Unlike conventional approaches that\npredict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by\nexplicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single\nautoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe\naction that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens\nare generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and\npreviously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a\nglobal-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained\nby the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA\nincorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token\nrepresentation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;\nreverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk\nmodeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial\ngeneralization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of\na visuo-motor policy.

Feed-forward scene\nreconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly\ncreate digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing\nmodels are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of\nmoving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene\nreconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training\ndata and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms.
