This process is computationally intensive and\nincreases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly\nmethod for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over\nsignals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a\ndirect quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high\nuncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.\nTo test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements\nderived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and\nuse it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that\nNTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and\nsimple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.\nFurthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding\nonly the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection\nperformance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs\ninto the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or\nNTPs alone.

Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as\nknowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions\nas visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the\ncaptions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and\nLLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning\ncapabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank\nAugmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to\nconvert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples\nfor the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to\nexclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to\nunderstand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the\nmodel's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end\ntraining.

In this work, we\nconduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between\nperceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are\nnot necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment\nemerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while\ndiscriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their\nlearned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone\ninitializations for IQA models.

We introduce the Domain Aware\nRule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal\nclustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly\ninto the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture\nby embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features\ninto a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule\nconsistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional\nclustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post\nhoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules\nare generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a\nloss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and\nviolation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets\ndemonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful\nand interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth\naircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering\nmetrics.

However,\nexisting VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on\nhard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across\ndiverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal\narchitectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable\ndata-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA\nannotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of\napproximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a\nmulti-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia\nCommons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel\ncoarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic\nsegmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural\nimages. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose\nan LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate\nreliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated\nimages and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis\nannotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to\nprovide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We\nperform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone\n,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT."}

To\naddress this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves\ntext-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation\non a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model\nto fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies\nsignificant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion\ntrajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is\ntrained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from\ntextual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently\nreconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations\non the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\\times$\nacceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing\non the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of\nthe generated videos, especially on complex tasks.

We introduce the\nCrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples\ninto the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM\nthen iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the\ndesired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a\ncoherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By\nincorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing\nmodel, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond\nthe environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then\nintroduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages\nCrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained\ntasks.

While traditional hair modeling methods focus on\nrealistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime\nhairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that\nchallenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh\nmodeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and\nunsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible\ncontrol-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points\nrepresents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric\nparameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both\nartist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this\nrepresentation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that\neffectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By\ninterpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential \"hair language\", our\nautoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle\ntopology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate\nboth training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct\nAnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with\nseparated hair cards and processed mesh data.
