However, because data from different modalities are\ntypically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental\nconditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution\ndiscrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.\nFurthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater\nchallenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to\ntackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from\nthat, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are\ntypically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature\ntransitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared\nto those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose\nlearning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to\nconstruct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the\ninconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to\neffectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To\nfurther address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning\ncomplementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as\nauxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet\noutperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols."}

This technology has seen rapid\nadvancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,\nmilitary surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant\nprogress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high\ncomputational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation\nacross diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of\nvarious HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,\nrepresentation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep\nlearning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets\nusing different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to\nanalyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,\nlimitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep\nlearning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical\nmodels demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to\nprovide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance\nthe field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods."}

In this\npaper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an\nend-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to\niteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,\nbased on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation\nframework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly\nadditional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge\nrobust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a\nbinary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.\nAdditionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual\ngrounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we\ndesign a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss\ncomputation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby\npromoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when\ntrained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding\nannotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared\nto GRPO, leading to 5.4\\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and\n5.2\\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.\nNotably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses\nOpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench.
