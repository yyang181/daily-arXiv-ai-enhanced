Transfer-based\nattacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these\nexamples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

Current methods struggle to\naddress these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In\nresponse, we introduce \\textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \\textbf{T}wo-stage\nnetwork via \\textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\\textbf{A}ttention, which can\nhandle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the\nbenefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes\npositional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the\nstate space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates\nexcellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS\nwhile maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the\nprevious state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets\nin both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation\ncosts by $1.86\\times$ and $3.29\\times$.

Although both are\nclass-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the\nformer aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter\nfocuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the\nbackground in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these\ntwo tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.\nHowever, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to\nlearning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both\nsalient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint\nlearning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost.

Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression.

To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions.

It plays a\nvital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction,\nembodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect\nthe affordance shared among different objects because they lack the\nChain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD)\ngeneralization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding\nframework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we\ndesigned a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format,\nperception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions.\nFurthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning\ndataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement\nlearning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves\nrobust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning\ncapabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms\nwell-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of\nour knowledge, Affordance-R1 is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with\nreasoning into affordance reasoning.

To address\nthese issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF\nutilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage\nin the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize\nquickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and\nrobust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across\ndiverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy."}

However, the protection algorithms\nwould become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques\nto bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach,\nAnti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within\nthe perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations,\nwhere the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the\nauthorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both\nprotection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain\nunder the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does\nnot disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the\nauthorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels,\npreserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering. ATP demonstrates\nits effectiveness in defending forgery attacks across various attack settings\nthrough extensive experiments, providing a robust solution for protecting\nindividuals' portrait rights and privacy.

In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this\nlimited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the\nreliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.\nThrough comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two\nprimary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within\nindividual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across\nsub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the\ninherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically\ncomposed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied\nenvironments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into\ndataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios\nwhere acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that\ncarefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce\nshortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving\ngeneralization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\\pi_0$, in\nboth simulation and real-world environments.
