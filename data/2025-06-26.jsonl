Among other factors, spray boom\ninstability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray\nbooms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and\nmachine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of\nthese booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the\nextent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include\nboom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was\nconducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom\nmovement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was\ndeveloped to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO\nV7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's\nmovements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the\nvertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the\nboom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The\nresults showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent\naccuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m\nof the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on\nthe current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor\nmodifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer\nbooms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy."}

In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions\n(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count\ndistributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating\ndense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss\nfunctions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly\nassume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,\nnon-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting\nframework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated\nPoisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional\nregression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,\nenabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count\naccuracy.

To\naddress the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial\ntransformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to\nthe substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the\nperformance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the\nregistration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized\nimages in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the\nregistration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight\nSpectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features\nfrom the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,\nthe obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered\nHSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are\nemployed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we\npropose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity\nregularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This\napproach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces\ncomputational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization\n(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.\nFinally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are\nconducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.\nWe also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance."}

This\ndenoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned\nlatent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of\nhigher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima\nthat are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally\nmisaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior\nefforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or\nmanipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random\nZigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect\nand escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first\nidentifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it\ninjects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current\noptimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,\naccepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat\nenables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random\nzigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and\nbackward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the\ngenerated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and\ncompatible with existing diffusion frameworks.

Despite promising results\nwere achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene\nevolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore\nperform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a\nrelatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based\npartition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within\ntwo stages. For the ``partition\" stage, a whole event proposal is split into\nshort video segments for captioning at a finer level.

We\nparticularly focus on the ``summarization\" stage, and propose a framework that\neffectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.\nWe achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and\nlearning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues.

When evaluating the quality of a PET/CT\nimage, both low-level features like distortions and high-level features like\norgan anatomical structures affect the diagnostic value of the image. However,\nexisting medical image quality assessment (IQA) methods are unable to account\nfor both feature types simultaneously. In this work, we propose MS-IQA, a novel\nmulti-scale feature fusion network for PET/CT IQA, which utilizes multi-scale\nfeatures from various intermediate layers of ResNet and Swin Transformer,\nenhancing its ability of perceiving both local and global information. In\naddition, a multi-scale feature fusion module is also introduced to effectively\ncombine high-level and low-level information through a dynamically weighted\nchannel attention mechanism. Finally, to fill the blank of PET/CT IQA dataset,\nwe construct PET-CT-IQA-DS, a dataset containing 2,700 varying-quality PET/CT\nimages with quality scores assigned by radiologists. Experiments on our dataset\nand the publicly available LDCTIQAC2023 dataset demonstrate that our proposed\nmodel has achieved superior performance against existing state-of-the-art\nmethods in various IQA metrics. This work provides an accurate and efficient\nIQA method for PET/CT. Our code and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/MS-IQA/MS-IQA/."}

One major challenge in FL\nis handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.\nCurrent solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or\ncustomizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a\nwell-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.\nAdditionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from\nintroducing public datasets.

To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation\nframework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).\nSpecifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic\ndata. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their\nparameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional\ndistillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions\nso that performances for both sides are improved.
