Ali", "Anis Koubaa", "Bilel Benjdira"], "title": "Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital\nimages, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in\nthe computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments."}

Existing token pruning\nmethods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,\nleading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy\ndifferences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively\non visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy\nthat explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal\ninformational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning\nstrategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual\ntokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual\nmodalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained\ntokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the\nexpected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently\nwith a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nmaintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as\nLLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference\nspeed."}

To this end, we introduce aleatoric\nuncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to\nachieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and\ncomputational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a\nsingle linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints.

By\nintroducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method\neffectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On\nthis basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark\ndataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale\narchitectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image\nreconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating\noverfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super\nresolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale\narchitectures under complex conditions.

GS-TG addresses a critical\ntrade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively\nreduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary\nrasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG\ngroups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across\ntiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations.

VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment\nwith VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool\nmanagement via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code\nexecution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous\nrollout execution achieving near 2$\\times$ speedup by eliminating\nsynchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating\ncompetitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as\nmulti-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),\nextending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on\nmathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web\nsearch, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to\nspecialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The\nmodular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only\nlightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and\nproviding a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research.

Project page: https://robix-seed.github.io/robix/", "summary": "We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task\nplanning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language\narchitecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot\nsystem, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level\ncontroller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to\nfollow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally\nwith human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel\ncapabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and\ncontext-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix\nleverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training\nstrategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning\nabilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and\ntask-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot\ninteraction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)\nreinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon\ntask coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both\nopen-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in\ninteractive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse\ninstruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and\ninterrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery\nshopping, and dietary filtering."}

To address these\nlimitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that\nleverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of\nrealistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune\na pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged\nin $2 \\times 2$ grids.

To address this, we propose FoRo, a\nforward-only, gradient-free continual learning method.

Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and\nload balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected\nalgorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a\nreal-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few\nminutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient\nlarge-scale image analysis."}

This paper identifies four core problems that must be\nsolved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)\ngeneralization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,\nspecifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)\nlong-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,\nspecifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We\npresent AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device\nassistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,\nclosed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this\nposition through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,\ntraining, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile\napplication development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal\nfoundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and\ncontrol layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task\nplanning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution\nlayer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice\ninteraction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and\ncomprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates\nprofiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across\nheterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant\nimprovements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,\nhigher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,\nand faster, more resource-efficient runtime."}

Unlike the well-established\npixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and\nfragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids,\nneural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees,\neach offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a\nunified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D\nrepresentations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these\nrepresentations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency,\nand generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our\nexperiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D\ngeneration pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression\nwith autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction\nerrors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to\nevaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can\ninform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications,\nfacilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions\nin 3D generation.

In\ncontrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such\nas distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.\nSince such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth\ncameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual\ncapabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation\nis challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to\nvarious types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as\na simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth\nsignals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,\nwe develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from\nsimulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that\nCDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively\nbridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,\nwithout the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes\nseamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving\narticulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance\ndegradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing\nsimulation data and 3D information in general robot policies."}

While recent advances in\nnative agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,\naction, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data\nscalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of\nGUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we\npresent UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these\nchallenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for\nscalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI\nenvironment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox\nplatform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nUI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.\nOn GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on\nWindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean\nnormalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level\nperformance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,\nOpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to\nlong-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,\nhighlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of\ntraining dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and\nefficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's\npotential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization\nto real-world interactive scenarios."}
