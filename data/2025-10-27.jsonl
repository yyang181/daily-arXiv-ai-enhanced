These adapters are typically trained to\ncapture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using\nsingle-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image\ninevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle\nthe target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and\nlighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs\nthe model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we\nuncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to\neliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,\nconfounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or\nLoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The\nauxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like\nfacial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation\nquality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general\ndesign principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled\nrepresentations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what\nshould NOT be learned."}

Their capacity to precisely segment\nstructures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this\nrestriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global\ncontext and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based\narchitecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional\nFeature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as\nFM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper.

On the local\ntest sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically\nconsistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in\nimproved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.\nOn the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data\nachieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment\nstrategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline.

Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union\n(mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to\nstate-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for\nautonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise\nborder refinement with minimal effect on inference speed."}

Treating human hand as\ndexterous robot end-effector, we show that \"in-the-wild\" egocentric human\nvideos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully\naligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity\nand labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic\nhuman activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach\ncan generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language\ndescriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.\nWe process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training\ndataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide\nrange of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment\nvariations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.\nWe design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on\nthis dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely\nunseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount\nof real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and\ngeneralization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also\ndemonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with\nrespect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation\nfor scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable\nembodied intelligence."}
