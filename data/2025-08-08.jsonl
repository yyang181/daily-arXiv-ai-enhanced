Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely\nderaining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows\nthat it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation\nstudies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each\nbranch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components."}

When describing actions\nin images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.\ngrooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct\nverb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,\nwhich relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,\nresulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we\npropose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense\nclusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu\ndataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with\neach cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate\nmultiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation\nwith standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis\nsuggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,\noffering a more nuanced assessment of model performance."}

DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features\nacross all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally\nindependent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems\nfor different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$\nconvergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type\nalgorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly\noutperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on\nthe image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III\ndataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of\nX-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and\nlocally independent inference."}

SIGGRAPH 2025, 10 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that\nenables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve\nthis by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the\nphotorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works\nby inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular\nestimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows\nusers to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under\nthe new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this\napproximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to\npredict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable\nrendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling\nself-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our\nmethod represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control\nover lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,\nto in-the-wild relighting."}

We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of\npedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to\ndistribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction\nuncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses\nthese estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement\nlearning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt\nto distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a\n96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous\nstate-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times\nfewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three\nout-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when\nfacing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and\ntransitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real\nrobot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when\ninteracting with both sparse and dense crowds.

At its core, GE-Base is\na large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the\nspatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in\na structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent\nrepresentations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight,\nflow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference\nacross diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable\nevaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural\nsimulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.\nThe platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite\nmeasuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action\nalignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable\nand practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied\nintelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly."}
