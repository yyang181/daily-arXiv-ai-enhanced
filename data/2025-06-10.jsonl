There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the\ndomain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we\nrevisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not\nexplored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of\ndownstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.\nThen, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's\ninherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.\nBuilding upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),\nwhich is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current\nworks, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's\nattention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential\nexcessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further\ndesign the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific\nknowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to\nlearn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly\nby 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively."}

The first stage\ninvolves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second\nstage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement\nmodel. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion\nmodel, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view\nInjection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI\nsupplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference\nview with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency\nusing epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer\ntraining strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through\njoint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K\ndatasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that\nProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent\nSOTA methods."}

However,\nexisting fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where\nthe model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it\nmemorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these\nchallenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion\nfine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the\npredicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent\nwith that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject\nconsistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to\nmultiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject\nidentity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that\nincorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity\nbut also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP\nscores, background variation, and overall visual quality."}

The problem is challenging due to advances in AI\ngenerated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)\nand lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.\nRecent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection\nusing generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider\nfine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting\nin higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a\nphysics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to\nidentify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results\non real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed\nframework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate\nfor anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively.

To develop a nuclei segmentation\nalgorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,\nimage-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to\ntarget domain image representations. One of the important issues with\nimage-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the\ninformation content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this\nregard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei\nstructures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding\nspace for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological\nimage space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating\njudiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model\ndevelops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization\nframework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator\nautomatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The\nproposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within\nthe framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the\nimage patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity\nand model performance compared to other existing models having complex network\narchitectures. The performance of the proposed deep generative model, along\nwith a comparison with state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation methods, is\ndemonstrated on publicly available histological image data sets."}

In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep\ngenerative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and\nnormalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model\njudiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial\nattention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,\ncorresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective\nnuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled\nrepresentation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification\nor loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei\nsegmentation map as well as embedding information.

Despite its impressive\nalgorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices\nremains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper\npresents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.\nFirst, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of\ncommon terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve\nthis, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses\nshared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,\neffectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by\nidentifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,\nwe introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent\nblending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for\ncostly hardware sorters.
