Despite its advantages,\ndeveloping VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to\nthe time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging\ninstructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a\nnovel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the\ngeneration of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two\ncore components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the\ntext, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated\ndemonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module\nreceives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.\nBased on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant\ndata from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by\nchanging the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate\ntasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development\noverhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving\nindustrial needs."}

This study proposes two innovative approaches to\nenhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion\nfactor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the\nconversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter\n(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly\nestimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The\nexperimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.\nTests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show\nthat measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were\nreduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods.

In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning\nmodels has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this\npaper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater\ndetection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a\nframework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features\ncrater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the\nsecond stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater\nlocalisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and\npresent a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We\nconsider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon\nbased on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the\nmost balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in\nidentifying large craters with high precision."}

Prior work often regards DFT as a\nperformance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex\nmitigation techniques.

In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B.

The Inception1D component\ncaptures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional\nfilters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple\ntemporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range\ndependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of\nboth local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD\nseverity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy\nbased on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented\nseverity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal\nvariations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving\nclassification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive\nexperimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming\nexisting state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment.

As online videos are\nstreaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient\nto store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to\nstore recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating\nwhether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target\nevent. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain\nlong-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an\nevent-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals\nthat model event-level information with various durations. To preserve\nhistorically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event\nmemory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent\nand long-term information.

However, aligning\nmedical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high\nSNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this\npaper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment\neffectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level\nvision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to\ndifferentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical\nstructure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling\nmethod to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging\nVQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This\nprocess amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in\nabnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of\nabnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures\nthe diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate\nalignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two\nchest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset,\nMedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across\nmultiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

Given a data\nvizualization, DRIVE-T supports the identification of task-based items\ndiscriminability and representativeness for measuring levels of data\nvisualization literacy. DRIVE-T consists of three steps: (1) tagging task-based\nitems associated with a set of data vizualizations; (2) rating them by\nindependent raters for their difficulty; (3) analysing raters' raw scores\nthrough a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model. In this way, we can observe the\nemergence of difficulty levels of the measurement construct, derived from the\ndiscriminability and representativeness of task-based items for each data\nvizualization, ordered into Many-Facets construct levels. In this study, we\nshow and apply each step of the methodology to an item bank, which models the\ndifficulty levels of a measurement construct approximating a latent construct\nfor data visualization literacy. This measurement construct is drawn from\nsemiotics, i.e., based on the syntax, semantics and pragmatics knowledge that\neach data visualization may require to be mastered by people. The DRIVE-T\nmethodology operationalises an inductive approach, observable in a post-design\nphase of the items preparation, for formative-style and practice-based\nmeasurement construct emergence. A pilot study with items selected through the\napplication of DRIVE-T is also presented to test our approach."}

While prior works have\ndemonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic\nrepresentations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics.

To address this,\nwe leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture\nspike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We\npropose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic\ndeep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the\nhierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual\ncortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our\nresults show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features\nacross simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically\nleads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture\nexhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1\naccuracy, compared to a 3\\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the\nbest-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in\nbrain-likeness.
