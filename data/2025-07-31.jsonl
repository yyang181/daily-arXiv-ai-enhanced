Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade\ngliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose\ndiagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI\nsequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual\nannotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),\nT2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D\nnnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation\nperformance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared\nagainst intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust\nperformance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator\nvariability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean\nDSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by\ntumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2\nalone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL\nis feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and\nCC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement.

Here, we leverage recent advances in computer\nvision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns\ntransferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via\nspatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning.\nUsing pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human\nConnectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves\ndownstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory\nand cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate\nperformance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient\nattention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in\npretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer\nlearning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome\nchallenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data."}
