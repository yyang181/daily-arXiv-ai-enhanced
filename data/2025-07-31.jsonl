Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade\ngliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose\ndiagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI\nsequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual\nannotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),\nT2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D\nnnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation\nperformance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared\nagainst intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust\nperformance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator\nvariability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean\nDSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by\ntumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2\nalone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL\nis feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT.

To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of\npredicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event\nlevel emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer\nand S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group\nmembers, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing\nmulti-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions\nprimarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,\nwe extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic\nanalysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims\nto predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and\narousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our\nbenchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses\nholistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on\nVGAF-GEMS benchmarking.

However, existing benchmarks\ndesigned for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique\ncomplexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and\ndiversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored\nspecifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service\nrobots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and\n46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.\nParticipants performed various human actions in diverse environments at\ndistances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,\nsimulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights\ndue to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to\nadvance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we\npropose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long\ndistances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic\nEllipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human\nactions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our\ncode is available at:\nhttps://github.com/wangzy01/ACTIVE-Action-from-Robotic-View."}

In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to\nestimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to\ncommon factors of real-world variation.
