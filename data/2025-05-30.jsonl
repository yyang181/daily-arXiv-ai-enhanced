To address\nthese challenges, we introduce a Unified Receptance Weighted Key Value (URWKV)\nmodel with multi-state perspective, enabling flexible and effective degradation\nrestoration for low-light images. Specifically, we customize the core URWKV\nblock to perceive and analyze complex degradations by leveraging multiple\nintra- and inter-stage states. First, inspired by the pupil mechanism in the\nhuman visual system, we propose Luminance-adaptive Normalization (LAN) that\nadjusts normalization parameters based on rich inter-stage states, allowing for\nadaptive, scene-aware luminance modulation. Second, we aggregate multiple\nintra-stage states through exponential moving average approach, effectively\ncapturing subtle variations while mitigating information loss inherent in the\nsingle-state mechanism. To reduce the degradation effects commonly associated\nwith conventional skip connections, we propose the State-aware Selective Fusion\n(SSF) module, which dynamically aligns and integrates multi-state features\nacross encoder stages, selectively fusing contextual information. In comparison\nto state-of-the-art models, our URWKV model achieves superior performance on\nvarious benchmarks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and\ncomputational resources."}

A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and\ntext tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition.\nBased on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic\nand label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR.

We first propose a reinforcement learning method\nBalanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to\ndecide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the\nnumber and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose\nattention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that\nsupplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention.\nTherefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token\nROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at\nthe visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection.\nExperiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate\nthat Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing\nhallucinations.

In this\npaper, we leverage metric learning techniques to investigate how the\ndistribution of prompts affects fine-tuning performance. Specifically, we\npropose a novel framework, Distribution Aware Visual Prompt Tuning (DA-VPT), to\nguide the distributions of the prompts by learning the distance metric from\ntheir class-related semantic data. Our method demonstrates that the prompts can\nserve as an effective bridge to share semantic information between image\npatches and the class token. We extensively evaluated our approach on popular\nbenchmarks in both recognition and segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate\nthat our approach enables more effective and efficient fine-tuning of ViT\nmodels by leveraging semantic information to guide the learning of the prompts,\nleading to improved performance on various downstream vision tasks."}

Traditional\ntrackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex\nscenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic\nunderstanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning,\nsuggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to\nVOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and\ncomprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target\nobject's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information;\ninefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and\ntextual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack\nof temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language\ndomain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the\nobject's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full\npotential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive\nLanguage Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker\nintroduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual\nbranch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions\nderived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with\nsemantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual\nrepresentation.
