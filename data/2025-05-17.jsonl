While traditional category learning models represent each\nexample as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is\nthought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed\ngraphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of\nshared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here,\nwe introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that\nemploys deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured\nrepresentations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept\ncalled a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity\nthat weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a\nmechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to\nselective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces\nhuman-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model\nthat uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model,\nand a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find\nthat PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that\nincreases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the\ncontribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that\nstructured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling\nrapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how\ndeep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models."}

As\na result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation\n(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and\nunlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA\nmethods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and\nself-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target\ndomain model.

MMRL generates space tokens projected\ninto both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more\neffective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize\nclass token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder\nlayers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneral knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and\nrepresentation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is\napplied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection\nlayer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To\nfurther promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning\nclass and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,\na decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base\ntasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger\ngeneralization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient\nand interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters\nand enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of\nrepresentation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific\ninformation to propagate more effectively through the network.

The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is\nagnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics.\nThis decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the\nvision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For\nexample, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when\nrecognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end\nvision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision\ntokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive\nmodels that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT\nleverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the\nvision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives.\nETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal\narchitecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate,\nwithout the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the\nemployed large language models.

MASSV first\nconnects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight\ntrainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning\nusing responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions.\nComprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families\ndemonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers\nend-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV\nprovides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both\ncurrent and future VLMs."}

Project page:\n  https://customsvg.github.io", "summary": "Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their\nresolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing\ntext-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they\noften overlook an important need in practical applications: style\ncustomization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics\nwith consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing\nT2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.\nOptimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I)\nmodels for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.\nOn the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity,\nyet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to\nlimited SVG training data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization\npipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward\nT2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion\nmodel with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of\nSVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we\ncustomize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized\nT2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate\nhigh-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an\nefficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been\nvalidated through extensive experiments. The project page is\nhttps://customsvg.github.io."}
