Code available at https://github.com/ChimdiWalter/HyperTopo-Adapters", "summary": "Leaf-lesion segmentation is topology-sensitive: small merges, splits, or false holes can be biologically meaningful descriptors of biochemical pathways, yet they are weakly penalized by standard pixel-wise losses in Euclidean latents. I explore HyperTopo-Adapters, a lightweight, parameter-efficient head trained on top of a frozen vision encoder, which embeds features on a product manifold -- hyperbolic + Euclidean + spherical (H + E + S) -- to encourage hierarchical separation (H), local linear detail (E), and global closure (S). A topology prior complements Dice/BCE in two forms: (i) persistent-homology (PH) distance for evaluation and selection, and (ii) a differentiable surrogate that combines a soft Euler-characteristic match with total variation regularization for stable training. I introduce warm-ups for both the hyperbolic contrastive term and the topology prior, per-sample evaluation of structure-aware metrics (Boundary-F1, Betti errors, PD distance), and a min-PD within top-K Dice rule for checkpoint selection. On a Kaggle leaf-lesion dataset (N=2,940), early results show consistent gains in boundary and topology metrics (reducing Delta beta_1 hole error by 9%) while Dice/IoU remain competitive. The study is diagnostic by design: I report controlled ablations (curvature learning, latent dimensions, contrastive temperature, surrogate settings), and ongoing tests varying encoder strength (ResNet-50, DeepLabV3, DINOv2/v3), input resolution, PH weight, and partial unfreezing of late blocks. The contribution is an open, reproducible train/eval suite (available at https://github.com/ChimdiWalter/HyperTopo-Adapters) that isolates geometric/topological priors and surfaces failure modes to guide stronger, topology-preserving architectures."}

However, it remains challenging due to its nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and extended prediction horizons. To address this, we propose OptFormer, a novel encoder-decoder model that integrates phase-space reconstruction with a motion-aware attention mechanism guided by optical flow. Unlike conventional attention, our approach leverages inter-frame motion cues to highlight relative changes in the spatial field, allowing the model to focus on dynamic regions and capture long-range temporal dependencies more effectively. Experiments on NOAA SST datasets across multiple spatial scales demonstrate that OptFormer achieves superior performance under a 1:1 training-to-prediction setting, significantly outperforming existing baselines in accuracy and robustness."}

Existing systems typically downsample frames or feed dense visual embeddings to large-context language models, trading off temporal coverage against cost. We propose Semantic Event Graphs (SEG), a lightweight symbolic interface between video and language that replaces raw frames with compact temporal interaction logs. Our pipeline detects and tracks objects with YOLOv11, converts proximity patterns into START/END human-object events, and organizes them into a Temporal Scene Graph (TSG). At inference time, a query-aware pruning module identifies anchor entities and lexically relevant events, returning only a small subgraph which is verbalized and passed to Gemini 2.5 Flash for answer generation. On five YouTube videos (300-500 interactions each) and 120 automatically generated long-horizon questions, SEG achieves 65.0% accuracy using only 3.47k tokens per query, closely matching a full-log baseline (62.5% at 40.39k tokens) while reducing token usage by 91.4%. A short-context baseline restricted to the last 30 seconds collapses to 2.5% accuracy, underscoring the need for explicit temporal memory. These results show that symbolic temporal graphs can serve as an effective, plug-and-play memory layer for off-the-shelf vision-language models, preserving long-range reasoning ability while making long-form video question answering substantially more token- and cost-efficient. Code, logs, and event-extraction tools will be released for reproducibility."}

While existing works have shown that vision-language models (VLMs) can assist RL, they often focus on knowledge distillation from the VLM to RL, overlooking the potential of RL-generated interaction data to enhance the VLM. To address this, we propose COVR, a collaborative optimization framework that enables the mutual enhancement of the VLM and RL policies. Specifically, COVR fine-tunes the VLM with RL-generated data to enhance the semantic reasoning ability consistent with the target task, and uses the enhanced VLM to further guide policy learning via action priors. To improve fine-tuning efficiency, we introduce two key modules: (1) an Exploration-Driven Dynamic Filter module that preserves valuable exploration samples using adaptive thresholds based on the degree of exploration, and (2) a Return-Aware Adaptive Loss Weight module that improves the stability of training by quantifying the inconsistency of sampling actions via return signals of RL. We further design a progressive fine-tuning strategy to reduce resource consumption. Extensive experiments show that COVR achieves strong performance across various challenging visual control tasks."}

As a practical solution, machine unlearning aims to selectively erase unwanted concepts from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch. While most existing methods are effective for single-concept unlearning, they often struggle in real-world scenarios that require removing multiple concepts, since extending them to this setting is both non-trivial and problematic, causing significant challenges in unlearning effectiveness, generation quality, and sensitivity to hyperparameters and datasets. In this paper, we take a unique perspective on multi-concept unlearning by leveraging model sparsity and propose the Forget It All (FIA) framework. FIA first introduces Contrastive Concept Saliency to quantify each weight connection's contribution to a target concept. It then identifies Concept-Sensitive Neurons by combining temporal and spatial information, ensuring that only neurons consistently responsive to the target concept are selected. Finally, FIA constructs masks from the identified neurons and fuses them into a unified multi-concept mask, where Concept-Agnostic Neurons that broadly support general content generation are preserved while concept-specific neurons are pruned to remove the targets. FIA is training-free and requires only minimal hyperparameter tuning for new tasks, thereby promoting a plug-and-play paradigm. Extensive experiments across three distinct unlearning tasks demonstrate that FIA achieves more reliable multi-concept unlearning, improving forgetting effectiveness while maintaining semantic fidelity and image quality."}

We introduce HAERAE-Vision, a benchmark of 653 real-world visual questions from Korean online communities (0.76% survival from 86K candidates), each paired with an explicit rewrite, yielding 1,306 query variants in total. Evaluating 39 VLMs, we find that even state-of-the-art models (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieve under 50% on the original queries. Crucially, query explicitation alone yields 8 to 22 point improvements, with smaller models benefiting most. We further show that even with web search, under-specified queries underperform explicit queries without search, revealing that current retrieval cannot compensate for what users leave unsaid. Our findings demonstrate that a substantial portion of VLM difficulty stem from natural query under-specification instead of model capability, highlighting a critical gap between benchmark evaluation and real-world deployment."}

This paper investigates the latent organization of handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using three complementary dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Rather than focusing on classification accuracy, we study how each method characterizes intrinsic dimensionality, shared variation, and nonlinear geometry. PCA reveals dominant global variance directions and enables high-fidelity reconstructions using a small number of components. FA decomposes digits into interpretable latent handwriting primitives corresponding to strokes, loops, and symmetry. UMAP uncovers nonlinear manifolds that reflect smooth stylistic transitions between digit classes. Together, these results demonstrate that handwritten digits occupy a structured low-dimensional manifold and that different statistical frameworks expose complementary aspects of this structure."}

This pipeline primarily optimizes probability sampling efficiency and aligns output distributions, but fails to activate the intrinsic intelligence required for dynamic visual exploration. In this work, we propose TIR-Flow, a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from passive processing to active video searching and reasoning without additional data or parameter updating.

Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that TIR-Flow significantly outperforms recent strong baselines, delivering an average performance boost of 5.9%, with gains reaching 10.5% on Egoschema.

With the growing availability of online cooking videos, there is unprecedented potential to study such culinary variations using computational tools systematically.

This work presents the first large-scale, curated dataset of biryani preparation videos, comprising 120 high-quality YouTube recordings across 12 distinct regional styles. We propose a multi-stage framework leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) to segment videos into fine-grained procedural units and align them with audio transcripts and canonical recipe text. Building on these aligned representations, we introduce a video comparison pipeline that automatically identifies and explains procedural differences between regional variants. We construct a comprehensive question-answer (QA) benchmark spanning multiple reasoning levels to evaluate procedural understanding in VLMs. Our approach employs multiple VLMs in complementary roles, incorporates human-in-the-loop verification for high-precision tasks, and benchmarks several state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. The resulting dataset, comparison methodology, and QA benchmark provide a new testbed for evaluating VLMs on structured, multimodal reasoning tasks and open new directions for computational analysis of cultural heritage through cooking videos.

Conventional approaches address only fragments of this challenge. Reconstruction-based models capture low-level deviations without contextual reasoning, object detectors provide speed but limited semantics, and large vision-language systems deliver interpretability at prohibitive computational cost. This work introduces a cascading multi-agent framework that unifies these complementary paradigms into a coherent and interpretable architecture. Early modules perform reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, while higher-level reasoning agents are selectively invoked to interpret semantically ambiguous events. The system employs adaptive escalation thresholds and a publish-subscribe communication backbone, enabling asynchronous coordination and scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Extensive evaluation on large-scale monitoring data demonstrates that the proposed cascade achieves a threefold reduction in latency compared to direct vision-language inference, while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling.

This is useful in cases where the amount of data is large and labelling is expensive, such as in machine vision or medical imaging. Two particularities of machine vision are first, that most of the images produced are free of defects, and second, that the amount of images produced is so big that we cannot store all acquired images. This results, on the one hand, in a strong class imbalance in defect distribution and, on the other hand, in a potential label shift caused by limited storage. To understand how these two forms of imbalance affect active learning algorithms, we propose a simulation study based on two open-source datasets. We artificially create datasets for which we control the levels of class imbalance and label shift. Three standard active learning selection strategies are compared: random sampling, entropy-based selection, and core-set selection. We demonstrate that active learning strategies, and in particular the entropy-based and core-set selections, remain interesting and efficient even for highly imbalanced datasets. We also illustrate and measure the loss of efficiency that occurs in the situation a strong label shift."}

Existing approaches depend on costly pixel-level annotations which make training expensive. Existing weakly supervised methods rely only on image-level binary labels and focus on global classification, often overlooking local edge cues that are critical for precise localization. We observe that feature variations at manipulated boundaries are substantially larger than in interior regions. To address this gap, we propose Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP, which learns text prompts that intentionally encode non-semantic, boundary-centric cues so that CLIPs multimodal similarity highlights manipulation edges rather than high-level object semantics. SAPL combines two complementary modules Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) to exploit edge information in both textual and visual spaces. The proposed ECPL leverages edge-enhanced image features to generate learnable textual prompts via an attention mechanism, embedding semantic-irrelevant information into text features, to guide CLIP focusing on manipulation edges. The proposed HECL extract genuine and manipulated edge patches, and utilize contrastive learning to boost the discrimination between genuine edge patches and manipulated edge patches. Finally, we predict the manipulated regions from the similarity map after processing. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SAPL significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art localization performance."}

This paper systematically analyzes the root causes of hallucinations in MLLMs under RL training, identifying three critical factors: (1) an over-reliance on chained visual reasoning, where inaccurate initial descriptions or redundant information anchor subsequent inferences to incorrect premises; (2) insufficient exploration diversity during policy optimization, leading the model to generate overly confident but erroneous outputs; and (3) destructive conflicts between training samples, where Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) similarity causes false associations and unstable parameter updates. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework comprising three core modules. First, we enhance visual localization by introducing dedicated planning and captioning stages before the reasoning phase, employing a quality-based caption reward to ensure accurate initial anchoring. Second, to improve exploration, we categorize samples based on the mean and variance of their reward distributions, prioritizing samples with high variance to focus the model on diverse and informative data. Finally, to mitigate sample interference, we regulate NTK similarity by grouping sample pairs and applying an InfoNCE loss to push overly similar pairs apart and pull dissimilar ones closer, thereby guiding gradient interactions toward a balanced range. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces hallucination rates and effectively enhances the inference accuracy of MLLMs."}

Our approach leverages a generative diffusion model to generate radar data for multiple object categories, including pedestrians, cars, and cyclists. Specifically, conditioning is achieved via Confidence Maps, where each channel represents a semantic class and encodes Gaussian-distributed annotations at target locations. To address radar-specific characteristics, we incorporate Geometry Aware Conditioning and Temporal Consistency Regularization into the generative process. Experiments on the ROD2021 dataset demonstrate that signal reconstruction quality improves by \\SI{3.6}{dB} in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over baseline methods, while training with a combination of real and synthetic datasets improves overall mean Average Precision by 4.15% compared with conventional image-processing-based augmentation. These results indicate that our generative framework not only produces physically plausible and diverse radar spectrum but also substantially improves model generalization in downstream tasks."}

The most problematic area to researchers in image processing and computer vision is the human face which is a complex object with myriads of distinctive features that can be used to identify the face. The survey of this survey is particularly focused on most challenging facial characteristics, including differences in the light, ageing, variation in poses, partial occlusion, and facial expression and presents methodological solutions. The factors, therefore, are inevitable in the creation of effective facial recognition mechanisms used on facial images. This paper reviews the most sophisticated methods of facial detection which are Hidden Markov Models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Elastic Cluster Plot Matching, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gabor Waves, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Eigenfaces, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and 3D Morphable Model. Alongside the works mentioned above, we have also analyzed the images of a number of facial databases, namely JAFEE, FEI, Yale, LFW, AT&T (then called ORL), and AR (created by Martinez and Benavente), to analyze the results. However, this survey is aimed at giving a thorough literature review of face recognition, and its applications, and some experimental results are provided at the end after a detailed discussion."}

Our approach introduces a Two-Ways Splatting technique that accurately models the dual directions for intensity accumulation and transmittance calculation inherent in sonar imaging, significantly improving rendering speed without sacrificing quality. Moreover, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based noise model that captures complex sonar noise patterns, including side-lobes, speckle, and multi-path noise. This model enhances the realism of synthesized images while preventing 3D Gaussian overfitting to noise, thereby improving reconstruction accuracy.

Its primary goal is to benchmark state-of-the-art video models and measure the progress in multimodal perception. This year, the workshop featured 2 guest tracks as well: KiVA (an image understanding challenge) and Physic-IQ (a video generation challenge). In this report, we summarise the results from the main Perception Test challenge, detailing both the existing tasks as well as novel additions to the benchmark. In this iteration, we placed an emphasis on task unification, as this poses a more challenging test for current SOTA multimodal models. The challenge included five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object and point tracking, unified action and sound localisation, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA, alongside an analysis and interpretability track that is still open for submissions. Notably, the unified video QA track introduced a novel subset that reformulates traditional perception tasks (such as point tracking and temporal action localisation) as multiple-choice video QA questions that video-language models can natively tackle. The unified object and point tracking merged the original object tracking and point tracking tasks, whereas the unified action and sound localisation merged the original temporal action localisation and temporal sound localisation tracks. Accordingly, we required competitors to use unified approaches rather than engineered pipelines with task-specific models. By proposing such a unified challenge, Perception Test 2025 highlights the significant difficulties existing models face when tackling diverse perception tasks through unified interfaces."}

Rather than modifying model architectures or optimization objectives, VideoWeave reorganizes available video-text pairs to expand temporal diversity within fixed compute. We systematically study how different data composition strategies like random versus visually clustered splicing and caption enrichment affect downstream performance on downstream video question answering. Under identical compute constraints, models trained with VideoWeave achieve higher accuracy than conventional video finetuning. Our results highlight that reorganizing training data, rather than altering architectures, may offer a simple and scalable path for training video-language models. We link our code for all experiments here."}

Our approach leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer (DiT). Given an input video, a user-provided object mask, and query tokens describing the target object and its effects, we localize relevant visual tokens via visual-text cross-attention and visual self-attention. This produces an intermediate effect mask that we fuse with the user mask to obtain a final foreground token mask to replace. We first invert the video through the DiT to obtain structured noise, then reinitialize the masked tokens with Gaussian noise while preserving background tokens. During denoising, we copy values for the background tokens saved during inversion to maintain scene fidelity. To address the lack of suitable evaluation, we introduce a new object removal metric that rewards temporal consistency among foreground tokens across consecutive frames, coherence between foreground and background tokens within each frame, and dissimilarity between the input and output foreground tokens. Experiments on DAVIS and a newly curated real-world associated effect benchmark (WIPER-Bench) show that Object-WIPER surpasses both training-based and training-free baselines in terms of the metric, achieving clean removal and temporally stable reconstruction without any retraining. Our new benchmark, source code, and pre-trained models will be publicly available."}

Existing methods for predicting student engagement typically require substantial annotated data to model the diversity of student behaviors, yet privacy concerns often restrict researchers to their own proprietary datasets. Moreover, the classroom context, represented in peers' actions, is ignored. To address the aforementioned limitation, we propose a novel three-stage framework for video-based student engagement measurement. First, we explore the few-shot adaptation of the vision-language model for student action recognition, which is fine-tuned to distinguish among action categories with a few training samples. Second, to handle continuous and unpredictable student actions, we utilize the sliding temporal window technique to divide each student's 2-minute-long video into non-overlapping segments. Each segment is assigned an action category via the fine-tuned VLM model, generating a sequence of action predictions. Finally, we leverage the large language model to classify this entire sequence of actions, together with the classroom context, as belonging to an engaged or disengaged student. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying student engagement."}

Our approach adopts a hierarchical pipeline that first outpaints key frames and then completes intermediate frames via an interpolation model conditioned on the completed boundaries, reducing error accumulation in sequential processing. At the model level, we augment a pretrained image inpainting backbone with (i) an Enhanced Spatial-Temporal module featuring 3D windowed attention for stronger spatiotemporal interaction, and (ii) global feature guidance that distills OpenCLIP features from observed regions across all frames into compact global tokens using a dedicated extractor.

In applied fields such as social health research, several critical questions arise: which models are most appropriate, whether to adopt unsupervised training strategies, what training scale is feasible under computational constraints, and how much such strategies benefit downstream performance. These decisions are often costly and require specialized expertise.\n  In this paper, we answer these questions through empirical analysis and provide practical insights into how to select and adapt foundation models for datasets with limited size and labels, while leveraging larger, unlabeled datasets through unsupervised training.

However, these models often hallucinate details that are not present in the image to satisfy user prompts. While recent datasets and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate systematic hallucinations in VLMs, many hallucination behaviors remain insufficiently characterized. In particular, prior work primarily focuses on object presence or absence, leaving it unclear how prompt phrasing and structural constraints can systematically induce hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how different forms of prompt pressure influence hallucination behavior. We introduce Ghost-100, a procedurally generated dataset of synthetic scenes in which key visual details are deliberately removed, enabling controlled analysis of absence-based hallucinations. Using a structured 5-Level Prompt Intensity Framework, we vary prompts from neutral queries to toxic demands and rigid formatting constraints. We evaluate three representative open-weight VLMs: MiniCPM-V 2.6-8B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen3-VL-8B. Across all three models, hallucination rates do not increase monotonically with prompt intensity. All models exhibit reductions at higher intensity levels at different thresholds, though not all show sustained reduction under maximum coercion. These results suggest that current safety alignment is more effective at detecting semantic hostility than structural coercion, revealing model-specific limitations in handling compliance pressure.

However, their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. Prior work in 2D VLMs has shown that the integration of visual inputs significantly increases vulnerability to adversarial attacks, making these models easier to manipulate into generating toxic or misleading outputs. In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating 3D vision similarly compromises the robustness of 3D VLMs. To this end, we present the first systematic study of adversarial robustness in point-based 3D VLMs. We propose two complementary attack strategies: \\textit{Vision Attack}, which perturbs the visual token features produced by the 3D encoder and projector to assess the robustness of vision-language alignment; and \\textit{Caption Attack}, which directly manipulates output token sequences to evaluate end-to-end system robustness. Each attack includes both untargeted and targeted variants to measure general vulnerability and susceptibility to controlled manipulation. Our experiments reveal that 3D VLMs exhibit significant adversarial vulnerabilities under untargeted attacks, while demonstrating greater resilience against targeted attacks aimed at forcing specific harmful outputs, compared to their 2D counterparts. These findings highlight the importance of improving the adversarial robustness of 3D VLMs, especially as they are deployed in safety-critical applications."}

Starting with a lightweight Sparse Occupancy Encoder, SparseOccVLA generates compact yet highly informative sparse occupancy queries that serve as the single bridge between vision and language. These queries are aligned into the language space and reasoned by the LLM for unified scene understanding and future occupancy forecasting. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-guided Anchor-Diffusion Planner featuring decoupled anchor scoring and denoising, as well as cross-model trajectory-condition fusion.

Measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes, called visibility, need to be transformed into images for astronomical observations. These dirty images blend information from real sources and artifacts. Therefore, astronomers usually perform reconstruction before imaging to obtain cleaner images. Existing methods consider only a single modality of sparse visibility data, resulting in images with remaining artifacts and insufficient modeling of correlation. To enhance the extraction of visibility information and emphasize output quality in the image domain, we propose VVTRec, a multimodal radio interferometric data reconstruction method with visibility-guided visual and textual modality enrichment. In our VVTRec, sparse visibility is transformed into image-form and text-form features to obtain enhancements in terms of spatial and semantic information, improving the structural integrity and accuracy of images. Also, we leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to achieve additional training-free performance improvements. VVTRec enables sparse visibility, as a foreign modality unseen by VLMs, to accurately extract pre-trained knowledge as a supplement. Our experiments demonstrate that VVTRec effectively enhances imaging results by exploiting multimodal information without introducing excessive computational overhead."}

This creates a practical gap in the literature: the lack of a model that provides generative-level texture recovery at edge-deployable speeds. In this paper, we address this trade-off by proposing a hybrid Attention U-Net GAN. We demonstrate that the heavy iterative sampling of diffusion models is not strictly necessary for texture recovery. Instead, by integrating Attention Gates into a lightweight U-Net backbone and training within a conditional adversarial framework, we can approximate the high-frequency fidelity of generative models in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on the SID dataset show that our method achieves a best-in-class LPIPS score of 0.112 among efficient models, significantly outperforming efficient baselines (SID, EnlightenGAN) while maintaining an inference latency of 0.06s.

These results show despite excelling in knowledge-heavy evaluations, current MLLMs still lack fundamental visual primitives. Progress in BabyVision represents a step toward human-level visual perception and reasoning capabilities. We also explore solving visual reasoning with generation models by proposing BabyVision-Gen and automatic evaluation toolkit.

Our analysis shows this limitation stems from two factors: datasets face an inherent trade-off between realism and coverage of diverse blur patterns, and algorithmic designs remain restrictive, as pixel-wise losses drive models toward local detail recovery while overlooking structural and semantic consistency, whereas diffusion-based approaches, though perceptually strong, still fail to generalize when trained on narrow datasets with simplistic strategies. Through systematic investigation, we identify blur pattern diversity as the decisive factor for robust generalization and propose Blur Pattern Pretraining (BPP), which acquires blur priors from simulation datasets and transfers them through joint fine-tuning on real data. We further introduce Motion and Semantic Guidance (MoSeG) to strengthen blur priors under severe degradation, and integrate it into GLOWDeblur, a Generalizable reaL-wOrld lightWeight Deblur model that combines convolution-based pre-reconstruction & domain alignment module with a lightweight diffusion backbone. Extensive experiments on six widely-used benchmarks and two real-world datasets validate our approach, confirming the importance of blur priors for robust generalization and demonstrating that the lightweight design of GLOWDeblur ensures practicality in real-world applications.

State-of-the-art methods demonstrate strong performance when trained and tested within the same domain. However, they struggle to generalise to new environments due to limited training data and depth perception -- overfitting to specific camera intrinsics. Our method addresses this by estimating keypoint z-coordinates in a virtual camera space, normalised by focal length and image size, enabling camera-agnostic depth prediction. We further leverage this invariance to camera intrinsics to propose a self-supervised test-time optimisation strategy that refines the model's depth perception during inference. This is achieved by applying a 3D consistency loss between predicted and in-space scale-transformed hand poses, allowing the model to adapt to target domain characteristics without requiring ground truth annotations. V-HPOT significantly improves 3D hand pose estimation performance in cross-domain scenarios, achieving a 71% reduction in mean pose error on the H2O dataset and a 41% reduction on the AssemblyHands dataset. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, V-HPOT outperforms all single-stage approaches across all datasets and competes closely with two-stage methods, despite needing approximately x3.5 to x14 less data."}

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly employed for this task, existing approaches predominantly train models to associate events with timestamps in the forward video only. This paradigm hinders VLMs from capturing the inherent temporal structure and directionality of events, thereby limiting robustness and generalization. To address this limitation, inspired by the arrow of time in physics, which characterizes the intrinsic directionality of temporal processes, we propose ArrowGEV, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly models temporal directionality in events to improve both event grounding and temporal directionality understanding in VLMs. Specifically, we categorize events into time-sensitive (e.g., putting down a bag) and time-insensitive (e.g., holding a towel in the left hand). The former denote events whose reversal substantially alters their meaning, while the latter remain semantically unchanged under reversal. For time-sensitive events, ArrowGEV introduces a reward that encourages VLMs to discriminate between forward and backward videos, whereas for time-insensitive events, it enforces consistent grounding across both directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArrowGEV not only improves grounding precision and temporal directionality recognition, but also enhances general video understanding and reasoning ability."}

Accurate organoid instance segmentation is critical for quantifying their dynamic behaviors, yet remains profoundly limited by high-quality annotated datasets and pervasive overlap in microscopy imaging. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to alleviate reliance on scarce labeled data, conventional SSL frameworks suffer from biases induced by noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in overlapping regions. Synthesis-assisted SSL (SA-SSL) has been proposed for mitigating training biases in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We present the first adaptation of SA-SSL to organoid instance segmentation and reveal that SA-SSL struggles to disentangle intertwined organoids, often misrepresenting overlapping instances as a single entity. To overcome this, we propose Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU), which identifies erroneous pseudo-labels for overlapping instances and then regenerates organoid labels through instance decomposition. For image synthesis, we apply a contour-based approach to synthesize organoid instances efficiently, particularly for overlapping cases. Instance-level augmentations (IA) on pseudo-labels before image synthesis further enhances the effect of synthetic data (SD). Rigorous experiments on two organoid datasets demonstrate our method's effectiveness, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models using only 10% labeled data, and state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies validate the contributions of PLU, contour-based synthesis, and augmentation-aware training.

Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view.

The results demonstrate that pupil size normalization carried out by a modern autoencoder-based identity-preserving image-to-image translation model significantly improves verification accuracy. Participants were also able to determine whether iris pairs corresponded to the same or different eyes when both images were either authentic or synthetic. However, accuracy declined when subjects were comparing authentic irises against high-quality, same-eye synthetic counterparts. These findings (a) demonstrate the importance of pupil-size alignment for iris matching tasks in which humans are involved, and (b) indicate that despite the high fidelity of modern generative models, same-eye synthetic iris images are more often judged by humans as different-eye images, compared to same-eye authentic image pairs.\n  We offer data and human judgments along with this paper to allow full replicability of this study and future works."}

In this work, we target a fundamental bottleneck that arises when extending MLLMs to real-time video understanding: the global positional continuity constraint imposed by standard positional encoding schemes. While natural in offline inference, this constraint tightly couples perception and generation, preventing effective input-output parallelism. To address this limitation, we propose a parallel streaming framework that relaxes positional continuity through three designs: Overlapped, Group-Decoupled, and Gap-Isolated. These designs enable simultaneous perception and generation, allowing the model to process incoming inputs while producing responses in real time. Extensive experiments reveal that Group-Decoupled achieves the best efficiency-performance balance, maintaining high fluency and accuracy while significantly reducing latency.

Leveraging expert masks as spatial anchors, MedGround precisely derives localization targets, extracts shape and spatial cues, and guides VLMs to synthesize natural, clinically grounded queries that reflect morphology and location. To ensure data rigor, a multi-stage verification system integrates strict formatting checks, geometry- and medical-prior rules, and image-based visual judging to filter out ambiguous or visually unsupported samples.

We introduce Multi-view 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (MV-3DRES), where the model must recover scene structure and segment the referred object directly from sparse multi-view images. Traditional two-stage pipelines, which first reconstruct a point cloud and then perform segmentation, often yield low-quality geometry, produce coarse or degraded target regions, and run slowly. We propose the Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (MVGGT), an efficient end-to-end framework that integrates language information into sparse-view geometric reasoning through a dual-branch design. Training in this setting exposes a critical optimization barrier, termed Foreground Gradient Dilution (FGD), where sparse 3D signals lead to weak supervision. To resolve this, we introduce Per-view No-target Suppression Optimization (PVSO), which provides stronger and more balanced gradients across views, enabling stable and efficient learning. To support consistent evaluation, we build MVRefer, a benchmark that defines standardized settings and metrics for MV-3DRES.

Unlike existing works that utilize many reference images and have large network parameters, we directly match points based on the multi-view information between the query and reference images with a lightweight network.

However, a few methods predominantly focus on single-modal RGB features, neglecting the inherent correlation between scene depth and haze distribution. Even those that jointly optimize depth estimation and image dehazing often suffer from suboptimal performance due to inadequate utilization of accurate depth information. In this paper, we present UDPNet, a general framework that leverages depth-based priors from large-scale pretrained depth estimation model DepthAnything V2 to boost existing image dehazing models. Specifically, our architecture comprises two typical components: the Depth-Guided Attention Module (DGAM) adaptively modulates features via lightweight depth-guided channel attention, and the Depth Prior Fusion Module (DPFM) enables hierarchical fusion of multi-scale depth map features by dual sliding-window multi-head cross-attention mechanism. These modules ensure both computational efficiency and effective integration of depth priors. Moreover, the intrinsic robustness of depth priors empowers the network to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities, illumination conditions, and domain gaps across synthetic and real-world data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our UDPNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on popular dehazing datasets, such as 0.85 dB PSNR improvement on the SOTS dataset, 1.19 dB on the Haze4K dataset and 1.79 dB PSNR on the NHR dataset.

First, the iterative nature of the diffusion process introduces substantial latency. Second, the inherent stochasticity of these generative models compromises physical accuracy and temporal consistency. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel, end-to-end, deterministic, single-step neural rendering framework, RenderFlow, built upon a flow matching paradigm. To further strengthen both rendering quality and generalization, we propose an efficient and effective module for sparse keyframe guidance. Our method significantly accelerates the rendering process and, by optionally incorporating sparsely rendered keyframes as guidance, enhances both the physical plausibility and overall visual quality of the output. The resulting pipeline achieves near real-time performance with photorealistic rendering quality, effectively bridging the gap between the efficiency of modern generative models and the precision of traditional physically based rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our framework by introducing a lightweight, adapter-based module that efficiently repurposes the pretrained forward model for the inverse rendering task of intrinsic decomposition."}

We propose a \\textbf{face-only counterfactual evaluation paradigm} that isolates demographic effects while preserving real-image realism. Starting from real photographs, we generate counterfactual variants by editing only facial attributes related to race and gender, keeping all other visual factors fixed.

We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source multimodal large language models under both the Workflow and Agentic paradigms, and the results show that Agentic is not consistently superior to Workflow: its gains depend on a model's ability to maintain the initial video anchors over long retrieval chains.

However, several prior works have reported that CoT can actually harm performance on visual perception tasks. These studies, though, examine the issue from relatively narrow angles and leave open why CoT degrades perception-heavy performance. We systematically re-examine the role of CoT in FGVC through the lenses of zero-shot evaluation and multiple training paradigms. Across these settings, we uncover a central paradox: the degradation induced by CoT is largely driven by the reasoning length, in which longer textual reasoning consistently lowers classification accuracy. We term this phenomenon the ``Cost of Thinking''. Building on this finding, we make two key contributions: (1) \\alg, a simple and general plug-and-play normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals, and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that combines ensemble rewards with \\alg to constrain reasoning length while providing dense accuracy-oriented feedback.

In this study, we propose a spatial multi-task learning framework for breast cancer molecular subtype prediction from clinically practical single-phase DCE-MRI. The framework simultaneously predicts estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and the Ki-67 proliferation index -- biomarkers that collectively define molecular subtypes. The architecture integrates a deep feature extraction network with multi-scale spatial attention to capture intratumoral and peritumoral characteristics, together with a region-of-interest weighting module that emphasizes the tumor core, rim, and surrounding tissue. Multi-task learning exploits biological correlations among biomarkers through shared representations with task-specific prediction branches.

Building on these insights, we propose a targeted adversarial attack framework for medical HSI, consisting of a Local Pixel Dependency Attack that exploits spatial correlations among neighboring pixels, and a Multiscale Information Attack that perturbs features across hierarchical spectral-spatial scales.

In the approach, the base learning leverages generative domain adaptation finetuning to finetune a pretrained generative encoder on a few examples of base classes by jointly incorporating a masked autoencoder (MAE) decoder for feature reconstruction and a fully-connected classifier for feature classification, which enables the model to efficiently capture general and adaptable representations. Using the finetuned encoder and learned classifier, we construct two class-wise memories: representation memory for storing the mean features for each class, and weight memory for storing the classifier weights. After that, the memory-regularized incremental learning is performed to train the classifier dynamically on the examples of few-shot classes in each incremental session by simultaneously optimizing feature classification and co-memory regularization. The memories are updated in a class-incremental manner and they collaboratively regularize the incremental learning. In this way, the learned models improve recognition accuracy, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting over old classes and overfitting to novel classes.

Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces test-time cooperative enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, improving adaptability and generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance, robustness, and generalization compared with state-of-the-art reliable multimodal learning approaches."}

Existing methods, relying on static fusion or LLMs, face computational redundancy and hallucination risks due to weak visual foundations. To address this, we propose DIVER (Dynamic Iterative Visual Evidence Reasoning), a framework grounded in a progressive, evidence-driven reasoning paradigm. DIVER first establishes a strong text-based baseline through language analysis, leveraging intra-modal consistency to filter unreliable or hallucinated claims. Only when textual evidence is insufficient does the framework introduce visual information, where inter-modal alignment verification adaptively determines whether deeper visual inspection is necessary. For samples exhibiting significant cross-modal semantic discrepancies, DIVER selectively invokes fine-grained visual tools (e.g., OCR and dense captioning) to extract task-relevant evidence, which is iteratively aggregated via uncertainty-aware fusion to refine multimodal reasoning. Experiments on Weibo, Weibo21, and GossipCop demonstrate that DIVER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 2.72\\%, while optimizing inference efficiency with a reduced latency of 4.12 s."}

Our framework includes four key components: A recorder that captures screen video along with precise user interactions like mouse clicks, keystrokes, and scrolls. A learner that semantically interprets these raw interactions and the surrounding visual context, translating them into descriptive natural language captions. A planner that reads the parsed demonstrations, maintains task states, and dynamically formulates the next high-level action plan based on contextual reasoning. An executor that faithfully carries out these action plans at the OS level, performing precise clicks, drags, text inputs, and window operations with safety checks and real-time feedback.

In contrast, scene graph-based image editing addresses this limitation by providing a structured representation of semantic entities and their relations, thereby offering improved controllability. However, existing scene graph editing methods typically depend on model fine-tuning, which incurs high computational cost and limits scalability. To this end, we introduce VENUS (Visual Editing with Noise inversion Using Scene graphs), a training-free framework for scene graph-guided image editing. Specifically, VENUS employs a split prompt conditioning strategy that disentangles the target object of the edit from its background context, while simultaneously leveraging noise inversion to preserve fidelity in unedited regions. Moreover, our proposed approach integrates scene graphs extracted from multimodal large language models with diffusion backbones, without requiring any additional training. Empirically, VENUS substantially improves both background preservation and semantic alignment on PIE-Bench, increasing PSNR from 22.45 to 24.80, SSIM from 0.79 to 0.84, and reducing LPIPS from 0.100 to 0.070 relative to the state-of-the-art scene graph editing model (SGEdit). In addition, VENUS enhances semantic consistency as measured by CLIP similarity (24.97 vs. 24.19). On EditVal, VENUS achieves the highest fidelity with a 0.87 DINO score and, crucially, reduces per-image runtime from 6-10 minutes to only 20-30 seconds. Beyond scene graph-based editing, VENUS also surpasses strong text-based editing baselines such as LEDIT++ and P2P+DirInv, thereby demonstrating consistent improvements across both paradigms."}

To address the gap in SD security, we propose Universal Diffusion Adversarial Purification (UDAP), a novel framework tailored for defending adversarial attacks targeting SD models. UDAP leverages the distinct reconstruction behaviors of clean and adversarial images during Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to optimize the purification process. By minimizing the DDIM metric loss, UDAP can effectively remove adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic epoch adjustment strategy that adapts optimization iterations based on reconstruction errors, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing purification quality. Experiments demonstrate UDAP's robustness against diverse adversarial methods, including PID (VAE-targeted), Anti-DreamBooth (UNet-targeted), MIST (hybrid), and robustness-enhanced variants like Anti-Diffusion (Anti-DF) and MetaCloak. UDAP also generalizes well across SD versions and text prompts, showcasing its practical applicability in real-world scenarios."}

This study evaluated the potential of AE embeddings as alternative predictors for LSM. Two AE representations, including retained principal components and the full set of 64 embedding bands, were systematically compared with conventional LCFs across three study areas (Nantou County, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and part of Emilia-Romagna, Italy) using three deep learning models (CNN1D, CNN2D, and Vision Transformer). Performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC analysis, error statistics, and spatial pattern assessment. Results showed that AE-based models consistently outperformed LCFs across all regions and models, yielding higher F1-scores, AUC values, and more stable error distributions. Such improvement was most pronounced when using the full 64-band AE representation, with F1-score improvements of approximately 4% to 15% and AUC increased ranging from 0.04 to 0.11, depending on the study area and model. AE-based susceptibility maps also exhibited clearer spatial correspondence with observed landslide occurrences and enhanced sensitivity to localised landslide-prone conditions. Performance improvements were more evident in Nantou and Emilia than in Hong Kong, revealing that closer temporal alignment between AE embeddings and landslide inventories may lead to more effective LSM outcomes. These findings highlight the strong potential of AE embeddings as a standardised and information-rich alternative to conventional LCFs for LSM."}

This requires diffusion models to reconcile high-frequency visual constraints and low-frequency textual guidance during the denoising process. However, while existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency, how to effectively couple this dual guidance to ensure strong adherence to the text prompt remains underexplored. In this work, we observe that in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based I2V models, certain intermediate layers exhibit weak semantic responses (termed Semantic-Weak Layers), as indicated by a measurable drop in text-visual similarity. We attribute this to a phenomenon called Condition Isolation, where attention to visual features becomes partially detached from text guidance and overly relies on learned visual priors. To address this, we propose Focal Guidance (FG), which enhances the controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers. FG comprises two mechanisms: (1) Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) leverages CLIP to identify key regions in the reference frame and uses them as anchors to guide Semantic-Weak Layers. (2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers, injecting explicit semantic signals and alleviating their over-reliance on the model's learned visual priors, thereby enhancing adherence to textual instructions. To further validate our approach and address the lack of evaluation in this direction, we introduce a benchmark for assessing instruction following in I2V models. On this benchmark, Focal Guidance proves its effectiveness and generalizability, raising the total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97\\%) and boosting the MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44\\%)."}

Our approach employs a lightweight, efficiently trained prefix-tuner to extract dynamic Visual-Evidence Weights, which quantify the evidentiary support for candidate tokens based on the visual input.

By actively aligning the watermark with visual evidence, VISA-Mark effectively maintains visual fidelity. Empirical results confirm that VISA-Mark outperforms conventional methods with a 7.8% improvement in visual consistency (Chair-I) and superior semantic fidelity.

We find that VAR scales exhibit two distinct pattern types: general patterns and specific patterns, where later-stage specific patterns conditionally optimize early-stage general patterns. To overcome the discrete latent space barrier in VQ models, we map sampling spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces via kernel density estimation (KDE), where high-density samples approximate stable, high-quality solutions. This transformation enables effective navigation of sampling distributions. We propose a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy: Top-k sampling focuses on high-density regions to preserve quality near distribution modes, while Random-k sampling explores low-density areas to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence. Consequently, VAR-Scaling optimizes sample fidelity at critical scales to enhance output quality. Experiments in class-conditional and text-to-image evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in inference process. The code is available at https://github.com/WD7ang/VAR-Scaling."}

To address this challenge, we introduce an Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image (OSCAR), a novel training-free method that retrieves a matching object model from an unlabeled 3D object database. During onboarding, OSCAR generates multi-view renderings of database models and annotates them with descriptive captions using an image captioning model. At inference, GroundedSAM detects the queried object in the input image, and multi-modal embeddings are computed for both the Region-of-Interest and the database captions. OSCAR employs a two-stage retrieval: text-based filtering using CLIP identifies candidate models, followed by image-based refinement using DINOv2 to select the most visually similar object. In our experiments we demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the cross-domain 3D model retrieval benchmark MI3DOR. Furthermore, we demonstrate OSCAR's direct applicability in automating object model sourcing for 6D object pose estimation.

This results in a disconnect between what the model internally understands and what it ultimately expresses, a phenomenon we describe as seeing it right but saying it wrong. To address this issue, we propose DualPD, a dual-perspective decoding refinement strategy that enhances the visual understanding without any additional training. DualPD consists of two components. (1) The layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module captures how the belief in the correct answer evolves by comparing output logits between layers that exhibit the largest attention shift. (2) The head-wise information filtering module suppresses low-contribution attention heads that focus on irrelevant regions, thereby improving attention quality within each layer. Experiments conducted on both the LLaVA and Qwen-VL model families across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DualPD consistently improves accuracy without training, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability. The code will be released upon publication."}

Rather than directly prompting chapters, we adopt a staged construction that first gathers reliable linguistic and visual evidence via curated ASR and frame-level descriptions, then refines coarse annotations into precise chapter boundaries and titles conditioned on the Temporal Chain-of-Thought, yielding fact-grounded, time-aligned narratives. We also observe that e-commerce videos are fast-paced and information-dense, with visual tokens dominating the input sequence. To enable efficient training while reducing input tokens, we propose the Scene-Primed ASR-anchored Compressor (SPA-Compressor), which compresses multimodal tokens into hierarchical scene and event representations guided by ASR semantic cues.

Due to heavy compute requirements, most large visual language models (VLMs) for VideoQA rely on a fixed number of frames by uniformly sampling the video. However, this process does not pick important frames or capture the context of the video. We present a novel query-based selection of frames relevant to the questions based on the submodular mutual Information (SMI) functions. By replacing uniform frame sampling with query-based selection, our method ensures that the chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA. We evaluate our approach on the MVBench dataset, which spans a diverse set of multi-action video tasks. VideoQA accuracy on this dataset was assessed using two VLMs, namely Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, both of which originally employed uniform frame sampling. Experiments were conducted using both uniform and query-based sampling strategies. An accuracy improvement of up to \\textbf{4\\%} was observed when using query-based frame selection over uniform sampling.

In contrast to the prevailing multimodal trend, we argue that effective layout analysis depends not on text-visual fusion, but on a deep understanding of documents' intrinsic visual structure. To this end, we propose PARL (Position-Aware Relation Learning Network), a novel OCR-free, vision-only framework that models layout through positional sensitivity and relational structure.

We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning."}

While recent studies use synthetic images to improve License Plate Recognition (LPR) results, there remain several limitations in these efforts. This work addresses these constraints by comprehensively exploring the integration of real and synthetic data to enhance LPR performance. We subject 16 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models to a benchmarking process involving 12 public datasets acquired from various regions. Several key findings emerge from our investigation. Primarily, the massive incorporation of synthetic data substantially boosts model performance in both intra- and cross-dataset scenarios. We examine three distinct methodologies for generating synthetic data: template-based generation, character permutation, and utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, each contributing significantly to performance enhancement. The combined use of these methodologies demonstrates a notable synergistic effect, leading to end-to-end results that surpass those reached by state-of-the-art methods and established commercial systems. Our experiments also underscore the efficacy of synthetic data in mitigating challenges posed by limited training data, enabling remarkable results to be achieved even with small fractions of the original training data. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and speed among different models, identifying those that strike the optimal balance in each intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings."}

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, primarily based on relative ranking, often suffer from severe reward sparsity and gradient instability, failing to effectively exploit the verifiable signals provided by 3D physical constraints. Notably, in standard GRPO frameworks, relative normalization causes \"near-miss\" samples (characterized by small but non-zero errors) to suffer from advantage collapse. This leads to a severe data utilization bottleneck where valuable boundary samples are discarded during optimization. To address this, we introduce the Smooth Numerical Reward Activation (SNRA) operator and the Absolute-Preserving GRPO (AP-GRPO) framework. SNRA employs a dynamically parameterized Sigmoid function to transform raw feedback into a dense, continuous reward continuum. Concurrently, AP-GRPO integrates absolute scalar gradients to mitigate the numerical information loss inherent in conventional relative-ranking mechanisms. By leveraging this approach, we constructed Numerical3D-50k, a dataset comprising 50,000 verifiable 3D subtasks. Empirical results indicate that AP-GRPO achieves performance parity with large-scale supervised methods while maintaining higher data efficiency, effectively activating latent 3D reasoning in VLMs without requiring architectural modifications."}

Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation. This study not only reveals the key weaknesses of VLMs, but also provides diagnostic tools and research directions for the development of robust models with real visual semantic reasoning capabilities."}

To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art.

However, this requires the use of pretrained external networks, introducing additional dependencies and reducing flexibility. In this work, we argue that DiTs actually have the power to guide the training of themselves, and propose \\textbf{Self-Transcendence}, a simple yet effective method that achieves fast convergence using internal feature supervision only. It is found that the slow convergence in DiT training primarily stems from the difficulty of representation learning in shallow layers. To address this, we initially train the DiT model by aligning its shallow features with the latent representations from the pretrained VAE for a short phase (e.g., 40 epochs), then apply classifier-free guidance to the intermediate features, enhancing their discriminative capability and semantic expressiveness. These enriched internal features, learned entirely within the model, are used as supervision signals to guide a new DiT training. Compared to existing self-contained methods, our approach brings a significant performance boost. It can even surpass REPA in terms of generation quality and convergence speed, but without the need for any external pretrained models. Our method is not only more flexible for different backbones but also has the potential to be adopted for a wider range of diffusion-based generative tasks.

Therefore, we propose a deep-learning CDA based on the OWLv2 model, which is built on a Vision Transformer, that has proven highly effective in various computer vision tasks.

Prevailing paradigms typically utilize Siamese encoders bridged by explicit difference computation modules, such as subtraction or concatenation, to identify changes. In this work, we challenge this complexity with SEED (Siamese Encoder-Exchange-Decoder), a streamlined paradigm that replaces explicit differencing with parameter-free feature exchange. By sharing weights across both Siamese encoders and decoders, SEED effectively operates as a single parameter set model. Theoretically, we formalize feature exchange as an orthogonal permutation operator and prove that, under pixel consistency, this mechanism preserves mutual information and Bayes optimal risk, whereas common arithmetic fusion methods often introduce information loss. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, including SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, PX-CLCD, WaterCD, and CDD, and three backbones, namely SwinT, EfficientNet, and ResNet, demonstrate that SEED matches or surpasses state of the art methods despite its simplicity. Furthermore, we reveal that standard semantic segmentation models can be transformed into competitive change detectors solely by inserting this exchange mechanism, referred to as SEG2CD. The proposed paradigm offers a robust, unified, and interpretable framework for change detection, demonstrating that simple feature exchange is sufficient for high performance information fusion.

Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones.

However, recent studies show that FL models may still leak sensitive information through their outputs, motivating the need for rigorous privacy evaluation. In this paper, we leverage membership inference attacks (MIA) as a quantitative privacy measurement framework for FL applied to remote sensing image classification. We evaluate multiple black-box MIA techniques, including entropy-based attacks, modified entropy attacks, and the likelihood ratio attack, across different FL algorithms and communication strategies. Experiments conducted on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that MIA effectively reveals privacy leakage not captured by accuracy alone. Our results show that communication-efficient FL strategies reduce MIA success rates while maintaining competitive performance. These findings confirm MIA as a practical metric and highlight the importance of integrating privacy measurement into FL system design for remote sensing applications."}

To address this gap, this work introduces Gamma2Patterns, a multimodal framework that characterizes deep cognitive attention by leveraging complementary Gamma and Alpha band EEG activity alongside Eye-tracking measurements. Using the SEED-IV dataset [1], we extract spectral power, burst-based temporal dynamics, and fixation-saccade-pupil signals across 62 channels or electrodes to analyze how neural activation differs between high-focus (Gamma-dominant) and low-focus (Alpha-dominant) states. Our findings reveal that frontopolar, temporal, anterior frontal, and parieto-occipital regions exhibit the strongest Gamma power and burst rates, indicating their dominant role in deep attentional engagement, while Eye-tracking signals confirm complementary contributions from frontal, frontopolar, and frontotemporal regions. Furthermore, we show that Gamma power and burst duration provide more discriminative markers of deep focus than Alpha power alone, demonstrating their value for attention decoding. Collectively, these results establish a multimodal, evidence-based map of cortical regions and oscillatory signatures underlying deep focus, providing a neurophysiological foundation for future brain-inspired attention mechanisms in AI systems."}

We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder.

Instead of adding new adapters as experts, Monkey Jump treats the adapters already present in each Transformer block (such as query, key, value, up, and down projections) as implicit experts and routes tokens among them. Routing is performed using k-means clustering with exponentially moving averaged cluster centers, requiring no gradients and no learned parameters. We theoretically show that token-wise routing increases expressivity and can outperform shared adapters by avoiding cancellation effects.

Recently, we have witnessed a paradigm shift that takes these techniques off the shelf and studies how to use them together to achieve the best results. One notable work is DP-FETA, which proposes using `central images' for `warming up' the DP training and then using traditional DP-SGD.\n  Inspired by DP-FETA, we are curious whether there are other such tools we can use together with DP-SGD. We first observe that using `central images' mainly works for datasets where there are many samples that look similar. To handle scenarios where images could vary significantly, we propose FETA-Pro, which introduces frequency features as `training shortcuts.' The complexity of frequency features lies between that of spatial features (captured by `central images') and full images, allowing for a finer-grained curriculum for DP training. To incorporate these two types of shortcuts together, one challenge is to handle the training discrepancy between spatial and frequency features. To address it, we leverage the pipeline generation property of generative models (instead of having one model trained with multiple features/objectives, we can have multiple models working on different features, then feed the generated results from one model into another) and use a more flexible design. Specifically, FETA-Pro introduces an auxiliary generator to produce images aligned with noisy frequency features. Then, another model is trained with these images, together with spatial features and DP-SGD. Evaluated across five sensitive image datasets, FETA-Pro shows an average of 25.7% higher fidelity and 4.1% greater utility than the best-performing baseline, under a privacy budget $ε= 1$."}

To achieve this, we design a training-free pipeline that first extracts and filters relevant geospatial features around the user's GPS location. It then detects major landmarks in user photos through VLM-based feature detection and projects them into the horizontal spatial plane. A geometric matching algorithm aligns photo features with corresponding geospatial entities based on their estimated distance and direction. The matched features are subsequently grounded and annotated directly on the original photo, accompanied by large language model-generated textual and audio descriptions to provide an informative, tour-like experience.

This mechanism enforces a \"Forest-before-Trees\" cognitive hierarchy, enabling the model to maintain a probabilistic superposition of global features before narrowing down to local details. Crucially, Laser maintains interpretability via decodable trajectories while stabilizing unconstrained learning via Self-Refined Superposition. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks demonstrate that Laser achieves state-of-the-art performance among latent reasoning methods, surpassing the strong baseline Monet by 5.03% on average.

Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models.

The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is a critical molecular biomarker that influences patient response to temozolomide chemotherapy. Traditional methods for determining MGMT status rely on invasive biopsies and are limited by intratumoral heterogeneity and procedural risks. This study presents a radiogenomic molecular imaging analysis framework for the non-invasive prediction of MGMT promoter methylation using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).\n  Our approach integrates radiomics, deep learning, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze MRI-derived imaging phenotypes and correlate them with molecular labels. Radiomic features are extracted from FLAIR, T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, and T2-weighted MRI sequences, while a 3D convolutional neural network learns deep representations from the same modalities. These complementary features are fused using both early fusion and attention-based strategies and classified to predict MGMT methylation status.\n  To enhance clinical interpretability, we apply XAI methods such as Grad-CAM and SHAP to visualize and explain model decisions. The proposed framework is trained on the RSNA-MICCAI Radiogenomic Classification dataset and externally validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset. This work advances the field of molecular imaging by demonstrating the potential of AI-driven radiogenomics for precision oncology, supporting non-invasive, accurate, and interpretable prediction of clinically actionable molecular biomarkers in GBM."}

This version includes minor lstlisting configuration adjustments for successful compilation. No changes to content or layout. Originally published at IEEE CCNC 2026", "summary": "3D object detection using LiDAR-based point cloud data and deep neural networks is essential in autonomous driving technology. However, deploying state-of-the-art models on edge devices present challenges due to high computational demands and energy consumption. Additionally, single LiDAR setups suffer from blind spots. This paper proposes SC-MII, multiple infrastructure LiDAR-based 3D object detection on edge devices for Split Computing with Multiple Intermediate outputs Integration. In SC-MII, edge devices process local point clouds through the initial DNN layers and send intermediate outputs to an edge server. The server integrates these features and completes inference, reducing both latency and device load while improving privacy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show a 2.19x speed-up and a 71.6% reduction in edge device processing time, with at most a 1.09% drop in accuracy."}

However, this expressiveness comes at a staggering cost: storing embeddings for every token inflates index sizes by over $1000\\times$ compared to single-vector approaches, severely limiting scalability. We introduce \\textbf{ReinPool}, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to dynamically filter and pool multi-vector embeddings into compact, retrieval-optimized representations. By training with an inverse retrieval objective and NDCG-based rewards, ReinPool identifies and retains only the most discriminative vectors without requiring manual importance annotations. On the Vidore V2 benchmark across three vision-language embedding models, ReinPool compresses multi-vector representations by $746$--$1249\\times$ into single vectors while recovering 76--81\\% of full multi-vector retrieval performance. Compared to static mean pooling baselines, ReinPool achieves 22--33\\% absolute NDCG@3 improvement, demonstrating that learned selection significantly outperforms heuristic aggregation."}

However, the majority of these mechanisms do not target federated learning directly nor do they aid in the aggregation step. This paper introduces Proof of Reasoning (PoR), a novel consensus mechanism specifically designed for federated learning using blockchain, aimed at preserving data privacy, defending against malicious attacks, and enhancing the validation of participating networks. Unlike generic blockchain consensus mechanisms commonly found in the literature, PoR integrates three distinct processes tailored for federated learning. Firstly, a masked autoencoder (MAE) is trained to generate an encoder that functions as a feature map and obfuscates input data, rendering it resistant to human reconstruction and model inversion attacks. Secondly, a downstream classifier is trained at the edge, receiving input from the trained encoder. The downstream network's weights, a single encoded datapoint, the network's output and the ground truth are then added to a block for federated aggregation. Lastly, this data facilitates the aggregation of all participating networks, enabling more complex and verifiable aggregation methods than previously possible. This three-stage process results in more robust networks with significantly reduced computational complexity, maintaining high accuracy by training only the downstream classifier at the edge. PoR scales to large IoT networks with low latency and storage growth, and adapts to evolving data, regulations, and network conditions."}

However, it is paradoxical that most unlearning methods require the unlearning requesters to firstly upload their data to the server as a prerequisite for unlearning. These methods are infeasible in many privacy-preserving scenarios where servers are prohibited from accessing users' data, such as federated learning (FL). In this paper, we explore how to implement unlearning under the condition of not uncovering the erasing data to the server. We propose \\textbf{Blind Unlearning (BlindU)}, which carries out unlearning using compressed representations instead of original inputs. BlindU only involves the server and the unlearning user: the user locally generates privacy-preserving representations, and the server performs unlearning solely on these representations and their labels. For the FL model training, we employ the information bottleneck (IB) mechanism. The encoder of the IB-based FL model learns representations that distort maximum task-irrelevant information from inputs, allowing FL users to generate compressed representations locally. For effective unlearning using compressed representation, BlindU integrates two dedicated unlearning modules tailored explicitly for IB-based models and uses a multiple gradient descent algorithm to balance forgetting and utility retaining. While IB compression already provides protection for task-irrelevant information of inputs, to further enhance the privacy protection, we introduce a noise-free differential privacy (DP) masking method to deal with the raw erasing data before compressing. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate the superiority of BlindU in privacy protection and unlearning effectiveness compared with the best existing privacy-preserving unlearning benchmarks."}

Jin Kim"], "title": "HERE: Hierarchical Active Exploration of Radiance Field with Epistemic Uncertainty Minimization", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.CV"], "comment": "Accepted to IEEE RA-L. The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "We present HERE, an active 3D scene reconstruction framework based on neural radiance fields, enabling high-fidelity implicit mapping. Our approach centers around an active learning strategy for camera trajectory generation, driven by accurate identification of unseen regions, which supports efficient data acquisition and precise scene reconstruction. The key to our approach is epistemic uncertainty quantification based on evidential deep learning, which directly captures data insufficiency and exhibits a strong correlation with reconstruction errors. This allows our framework to more reliably identify unexplored or poorly reconstructed regions compared to existing methods, leading to more informed and targeted exploration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical exploration strategy that leverages learned epistemic uncertainty, where local planning extracts target viewpoints from high-uncertainty voxels based on visibility for trajectory generation, and global planning uses uncertainty to guide large-scale coverage for efficient and comprehensive reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed method in active 3D reconstruction is demonstrated by achieving higher reconstruction completeness compared to previous approaches on photorealistic simulated scenes across varying scales, while a hardware demonstration further validates its real-world applicability."}

However, obtaining fully annotated data for all tasks is impractical due to labeling costs. Existing methods for partially labeled MTL typically rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, making it difficult to establish reliable task associations and potentially leading to negative transfer and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for robust multi-task learning, even when only a subset of tasks is annotated."}

Yet their potential for slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), the task of jointly estimating 3D anatomy and slice poses from misaligned 2D acquisitions, remains underexplored. We introduce a fast convolutional framework that fuses multiple orthogonal 2D slice stacks to recover coherent 3D structure and refines slice alignment through lightweight model-based optimization. Applied to fetal brain MRI, our approach reconstructs high-quality 3D volumes in under 10s, with 1s slice registration and accuracy on par with state-of-the-art iterative SVR pipelines, offering more than speedup. The framework uses non-rigid displacement fields to represent transformations, generalizing to other SVR problems like fetal body and placental MRI. Additionally, the fast inference time paves the way for real-time, scanner-side volumetric feedback during MRI acquisition."}
