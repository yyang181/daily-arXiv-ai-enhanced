Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos."}

XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks."}

Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence. Code can be found at https://github.com/Li-Hao-yuan/GeoThinker."}

In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class of architectures explicitly designed to admit a tractable non-linear PInv. The proposed non-linear PInv and its implementation in SPNN satisfy fundamental geometric properties. One such property is null-space projection or \"Back-Projection\", $x' = x + A^\\dagger(y-Ax)$, which moves a sample $x$ to its closest consistent state $x'$ satisfying $Ax=y$. We formalize Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP), a method that guarantees the same consistency constraint for non-linear mappings $f(x)=y$ via our defined PInv. We leverage SPNNs to expand the scope of zero-shot inverse problems. Diffusion-based null-space projection has revolutionized zero-shot solving for linear inverse problems by exploiting closed-form back-projection. We extend this method to non-linear degradations. Here, \"degradation\" is broadly generalized to include any non-linear loss of information, spanning from optical distortions to semantic abstractions like classification. This approach enables zero-shot inversion of complex degradations and allows precise semantic control over generative outputs without retraining the diffusion prior."}
