To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an\nextended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a\nunified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key\ninnovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer\n(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture\npartitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)\nand taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and\ncommon anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical\nshortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a\ndiffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces\ntwo large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for\nbirds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for\nbirds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on\nan aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining\nreal and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over\nexisting approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the\nchallenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset.
