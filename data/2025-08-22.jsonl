These methods involve computing\nthe argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not\ndifferentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,\nto enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this\nlong-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the\nonly way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative\ntraining objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.\nEmpirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial\nlandmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during\ntraining while maintaining better/competitive accuracy.

To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which\ncould provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion\nspace for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV\nCollaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct\naltitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,\nand a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training\nand evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising\n13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with\ntarget-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps\nand an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's\ngeneralization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.\nTo consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV\ncollaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a\nmultimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the\nlow-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and\ntarget grounding.

However, these methods depend on stale\noffline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable\ncomputational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a\nknowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models\nwith prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student\nmodel. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal\nknowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)\nparadigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with\nSD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with\nprior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge\ntransfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model.

We explore whether, in practice, the\nrepresentation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density\nestimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space\ntypically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational\nDiffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained\nResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in\ncomparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite."}

Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,\nbut their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor\nfeedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce\nDeep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for\nmedical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical\nretrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge\nsources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More\ncrutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its\nenvironment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,\nand diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from\nlarge-scale data through RL.\n  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework\nconsistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches\nacross multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves\nsubstantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic\nbaselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks\nfor both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and\nretrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the\nuniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional\nimplementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight\nimprovements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight\ninto its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more\nreliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

However, in high-value but\nmore challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely\non expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags\nsignificantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for\ntransforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between\nopen-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To\nmitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped\nwith general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze\nmultiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodel with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,\ncontinually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from\nscientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and\nthen online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose\nMixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks\nsimultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and\ntraining systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL\ntraining.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and\nsignificantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing\nclosed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular\nsynthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic\nstabilities for crystals.
