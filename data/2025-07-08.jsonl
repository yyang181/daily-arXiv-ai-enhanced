To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce\nTS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree.

While cross-attention models achieve\nstrong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic\ncomplexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this\nchallenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures\nthe power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent\npipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving\nmultimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion\nblock built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric\ncross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming\nmodality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit\n(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,\nenabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,\nrecurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it\nideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark\ndemonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex\nbaselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF\ncreates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive\nfusion mechanism.

The effect of regional consistency on\nclassification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data\nare two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To\ntackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with\nstatistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this\narticle. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature\nextractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is\ndesigned to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial\ninformation learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR\ncovariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first\ndynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and\npixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature\ninteraction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the\nclassification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected\ndistillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of\ndifferent frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency\ndata.

Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of\ndual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and\nrich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned\nvisible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nstate-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal."}

On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising\ndata while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time\nand memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the\ntransformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original\ndata. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and\nglobal shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in\nterms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the\nobjective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering\nguided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to\nserve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the\noriginal data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that\nmeasure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,\nrespectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of\ndatasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.\nResults reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art\nmethods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic\ncomplexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and\ndifferent choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric."}

The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming\n(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified\naccuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing\nvision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of\ntest data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on\nseven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,\nrelying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just\n1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.\nFurther, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in\nlabelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all\nmethods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated\ntest-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while\nachieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we\nshow that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional\n4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy."}

We propose a\nfully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual\nintervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be\nintegrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end\nmethods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact,\nmemory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing\nfor the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational\nresources or memory requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method\nthrough a variety of hairstyle examples, showcasing its potential for\nreal-world applications."}

In\nclinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the\nscreening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist\nis a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this\narea remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality\ninstance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with\nnarrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring\ndetailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression\nin RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis,\nwhich alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating\nexpertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist\nbone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii)\nSharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for\nwrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional\nradiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level\ninstance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548\nimages. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks\nrelated to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression\nquantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte\ndetection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal\nbone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the\nbarrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within\nthe RA-related domain."}

Yet, the significant\nReal2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of\nphysical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose\nEmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both\nthe physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,\na differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.\nIt jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and\nfriction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world\nobservations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a\nconditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by\ntranslating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos\nconditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The\nproposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%\ncompared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by\n89.91\\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic\nenvironment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate\nacross real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.

Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms\nto leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances\nvision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting\napproach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement\nlearning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve\nvision-language model responses by establishing preferences for\nnavigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided\nVision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and\nvision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve\nperformance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering\ntasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving\ngeneralization to diverse driving scenarios.
