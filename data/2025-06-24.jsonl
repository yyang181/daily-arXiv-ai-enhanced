We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the\nsubsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D\nbounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce\npixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby\neliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine\ngeometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question\nanswering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training\npipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D\npoint-wise labels.

This mechanism enables\neach region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature\ndimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN\nprovides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better\nadapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head\ncan directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only\na few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly\nimprove the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small\nimprovements. Various layer modules undergo extensive re-training."}

Weakly supervised learning\nprovides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse\nannotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance\ndegradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.\nTo address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised\ncross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main\ncomponents: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature\nlearning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the\nmodality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning\nnetwork effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal\nimages, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation\nperformance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides\nsegmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and\ninter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while\npromoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,\ndelivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both\nchallenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures.

Our proposed Incremental\nTraining Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by\nperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT\ndata. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards\non the COT data.

We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and\ntraining set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face\nmatcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)\nstrongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons.

While some generative models\nhandle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two\nmodalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while\npreserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nefficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that\nautomatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while\npreserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize\nthe task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with\naudio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first\ninsert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a\nframe-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,\npreserving the original video's semantic content.

However, prior work has focused on\nsolely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image\nportions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium\nto communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that\nleverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.\nImage Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their\nbias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias\nscore of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting\nbiased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three\nsteps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and\nthe image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by\ncomparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is\npromising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many\npotential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective\ntraining. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time,\nparticularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results.

Specifically, we\nintroduce the Global Multi-scale Sensing Module (GMSM), which extracts compact\nand informative latent representations from the entire image, effectively\ncapturing spatial dependencies within the latent space. Furthermore, to\nmitigate the information loss introduced during quantization, we propose the\nQuantization Compensation Module (QCM), which learns the distribution of\nquantization errors and refines the quantized features to compensate for\nquantization loss. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate\nthat our method achieves superior compression efficiency compared to\nstate-of-the-art lossless image compression approaches, while maintaining\ncompetitive inference speed.

The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling.

Our first stage\nutilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at\na coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,\nproducing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.\nSubsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to\nmap music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level\nsemantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic\ntokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to\npredict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to\niteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during\ninference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction\nrepresentation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive\ntwo-person dances across various genres. Extensive experiments and user studies\non a benchmark duet dance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of\nDuetGen in motion realism, music-dance alignment, and partner coordination."}

This is particularly\nbeneficial for breast imaging, where long acquisition times and high cost are\nsignificantly limiting the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as\na widespread screening modality. Recent studies have demonstrated the\nfeasibility of synthetic contrast generation. However, current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods lack sufficient measures for consistent temporal evolution.\nNeural cellular automata (NCA) offer a robust and lightweight architecture to\nmodel evolving patterns between neighboring cells or pixels. In this work we\nintroduce TeNCA (Temporal Neural Cellular Automata), which extends and further\nrefines NCAs to effectively model temporally sparse, non-uniformly sampled\nimaging data. To achieve this, we advance the training strategy by enabling\nadaptive loss computation and define the iterative nature of the method to\nresemble a physical progression in time. This conditions the model to learn a\nphysiologically plausible evolution of contrast enhancement. We rigorously\ntrain and test TeNCA on a diverse breast MRI dataset and demonstrate its\neffectiveness, surpassing the performance of existing methods in generation of\nimages that align with ground truth post-contrast sequences."}

Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud\nthat can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a\nchallenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has\nbeen transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we\npropose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis\n(TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need\nresource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we\nused the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike\nvoxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and\noutputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed\nTDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford\nRobotCar, KITTI-360) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for\nobject and place recognition. We have also tested TDACloud on noisy and\ntransformed test cases where the query point cloud has been scaled, translated,\nor rotated. Our results demonstrate high recognition accuracies in noisy\nconditions and large-scale real-world place recognition while outperforming the\nbaselines by up to approximately 14%."}

Existing literature\non improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such\nas prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the\npromising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by\nintervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we\npropose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the\nreasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually\ndesigned or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the\nreasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the\nquery by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not\nundermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,\nincluding DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can\neffectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance\nwell.

As a result, AE methods have\ntraditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments\nnon-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that\nutilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This\napproach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along\nwith its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory\nat different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In\ntotal, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting\nconditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with\npose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite\nSystem (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired\nat various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a\nRoot-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images.\nUsing this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that\nthe classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support\nreproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack\nacquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and\nperformance specifications.
