While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer\naccuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in\nreal-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and\nscalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small\nor occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object\ndetection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces\ntwo key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which\nintegrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance\nfeature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which\ncaptures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial\nlocalization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile\nphones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a\nprecision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of\n55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both\nsensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR\noffers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue\nmonitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future\nenhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and\nembedded optimization."}

Specifically, IPGA leverages the\nQ-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,\nwithout LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and\ntransferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query\nAlignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more\ncontrolled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show\nthat our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both\nstandard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual\nquestion-answering tasks in black-box environment.

We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known.

Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve\nmodels' ability to distinguish 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg} rotations, despite\nsubstantially improving the identification of 180{\\deg} images. Together, these\nresults reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities\nand human perception in identifying rotation."}

Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential\nfor comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges,\nincluding reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or\nspherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic\ninputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel \\textbf{Ca}rdiac \\textbf{L}atent\n\\textbf{I}nterpolation \\textbf{D}iffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces\nthree key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme\nbased on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships\nbetween sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a\ncomputationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds\nup 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational\noverhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as\ninput, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods,\neliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus\nsimplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the\neffective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence.\nExtensive volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks demonstrate\nthat CaLID achieves superior reconstruction quality and efficiency. By\naddressing the fundamental limitations of existing approaches, our framework\nadvances the state of the art for spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart\nreconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for\ncardiovascular imaging."}

To address these challenges, this work\nrevisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey\ninvolving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in\nproperty ratings across modalities.

To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and\nchallenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs\ncover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and\nsupport five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We\nconducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source\nmodels, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for\nexisting MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini\nachieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly\nhigher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks.
