This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR\n(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a\nnovel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a\nVideo-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into\ncompact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent \"visual event sequences\"\nthrough lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal\npooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual\nevent sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,\nspecifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt\nTuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on\nthe NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods\n(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the\ncritical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,\nwhile human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event\nrepresentations.

The enhanced voxel features\nproduced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or\nSSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,\nhighlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several\nbenchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based\nmodels.

Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image\ndiffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful\ndata augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To\nestablish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance\nsegmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong\nbaseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model\noutperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark.

To this end, we propose\nUnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation\nand reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a\npre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D\nframe, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model\nusing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise\nepistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,\nwe incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the\ndiffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose\nestimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global\nconsistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations\nare further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent\n3DGS field.

However,\nexisting multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal\nheterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired\ndata, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we\npropose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To\nmitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into\ntumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion\nmodule, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to\nbalance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we\npropose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns\ntranscriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on\npaired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling\ntranscriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To\nimprove inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation\nmodule that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics.\nExtensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction\ndemonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple\nsettings.

This work\npresents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning\nmodel development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing\nand classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on\nTinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes\ndataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for\nstructure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the\ndevelopment of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with\n12.59kiB parameter storage.

To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works\nemploy Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained\nstable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due\nto the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different\ngenerative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods\nto fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion\nNetwork for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,\nwhich projects the same image into different latent features based on\ntimesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,\nthe student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the\npre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative\ncapabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different\ntimesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the\nstudent model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent\ngenerative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though\nutilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can\nnaturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by\nchanging the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results\nwith only a single step."}

Federated learning (FL) provides a\nprivacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints\nimposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the\nscarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical\nSemi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only\nunlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,\nhigh-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of\nExperts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox\ntackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse\nMixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features\nacross resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised\nlearning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on\nreal-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively\nadapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained\nmemory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and\nprivacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios."}

The model was developed via a two-stage\npre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with\ndomain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning\nobjective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and\ndiagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior\ngeneralizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of\nkidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and\nsurvival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT\nfoundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free\nsurvival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726,\nrepresenting a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading\nbaselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data\nefficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training\ndata to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they\nwere fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior\nperformance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis\ntasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the\npotential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and\npersonalize the management of patients with kidney cancer."}
