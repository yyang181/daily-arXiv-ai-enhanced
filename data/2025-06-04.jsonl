While these systems are\ntypically understood as detecting gender, they often classify datapoints based\non observable features correlated at best with either male or female sex. In\naddition to questionable binary assumptions, from an epistemological point of\nview, this is problematic for two reasons. First, there exists a gap between\nthe categories the system is meant to predict (woman versus man) and those onto\nwhich their output reasonably maps (female versus male). What is more, gender\ncannot be inferred on the basis of such observable features. This makes AGR\ntools often unreliable, especially in the case of non-binary and gender\nnon-conforming people. We suggest a theoretical and practical rethinking of AGR\nsystems. To begin, distinctions are made between sex, gender, and gender\nexpression. Then, we build upon the observation that, unlike algorithmic\nmisgendering, human-human misgendering is open to the possibility of\nre-evaluation and correction. We suggest that analogous dynamics should be\nrecreated in AGR, giving users the possibility to correct the system's output.\nWhile implementing such a feedback mechanism could be regarded as diminishing\nthe system's autonomy, it represents a way to significantly increase fairness\nlevels in AGR.

We\nfirst conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of\ndiverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each\nmotion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building\non this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a\nphysical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of\ngenerated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency\ndomain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to\nconform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network\nfunctionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across\nmultiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without\ncompromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain\nphysical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video\ngeneration architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating\nphysical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This\nwork seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and\nphysics-based motion models."}

Specifically, GRC employs a dual-branch architecture designed to\nindependently process geometric and reflectance features initially, thereby\ncapitalizing on their distinct characteristic. Then, GRC adopts a robust\nmulti-level feature collaboration module to suppress redundant and unreliable\ninformation from both branches. Consequently, without complex simulation or\naugmentation, our method effectively extracts intrinsic information about the\nscene while suppressing interference, thus achieving better robustness and\ngeneralization in adverse weather conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof GRC through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, showing\nthat our method outperforms previous approaches and establishes new\nstate-of-the-art results."}

In this paper, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to\nsystematically model this real-world challenge and introduce a novel method to\nsolve it. We define a task called \"Modelship Attribution\", which aims to trace\nthe evolution of manipulated images by identifying the generative models\ninvolved and reconstructing the sequence of edits they performed. To\nrealistically simulate this scenario, we utilize three generative models,\nStyleMapGAN, DiffSwap, and FacePartsSwap, that sequentially modify distinct\nregions of the same image. This process leads to the creation of the first\nmodelship dataset, comprising 83,700 images (16,740 images*5). Given that later\nedits often overwrite the fingerprints of earlier models, the focus shifts from\nextracting blended fingerprints to characterizing each model's distinctive\nediting patterns. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the modelship\nattribution transformer (MAT), a purpose-built framework designed to\neffectively recognize and attribute the contributions of various models within\ncomplex, multi-stage manipulation workflows.

While training neural\nnetworks requires a large amount of data, data with perfect labels are scarce\nand only available within developed regions. The trained models therefore lack\ngeneralizability, which limits the potential for large-scale application of\nexisting methods. We tackle this problem for the first time, by introducing\ndata with imperfect labels into training pixel-wise height estimation networks,\nincluding labels that are incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate compared to\nhigh-quality labels. We propose an ensemble-based pipeline compatible with any\nmonocular height estimation network. Taking the challenges of noisy labels,\ndomain shift, and long-tailed distribution of height values into consideration,\nwe carefully design the architecture and loss functions to leverage the\ninformation concealed in imperfect labels using weak supervision through\nbalanced soft losses and ordinal constraints. We conduct extensive experiments\non two datasets with different resolutions, DFC23 (0.5 to 1 m) and GBH (3 m).\nThe results indicate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baselines by\nachieving more balanced performance across various domains, leading to\nimprovements of average root mean square errors up to 22.94 %, and 18.62 % on\nDFC23 and GBH, respectively.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First,\nto suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering\nModule (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively\nremove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules,\nit does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset.\nFurther, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each\nexpert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during\nrunning time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the\ndiversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of\nsemantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to\ngenerate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint\nmodeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce\nmodality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion\nframe-difference contrastive loss.

Existing general-purpose vision-language models fail to address\nthese needs due to insufficient domain-specific supervision and the lack of a\nlarge-scale high-quality surgical database. To bridge this gap, we propose\nSurgVLM, one of the first large vision-language foundation models for surgical\nintelligence, where this single universal model can tackle versatile surgical\ntasks. To enable this, we construct a large-scale multimodal surgical database,\nSurgVLM-DB, comprising over 1.81 million frames with 7.79 million\nconversations, spanning more than 16 surgical types and 18 anatomical\nstructures. We unify and reorganize 23 public datasets across 10 surgical\ntasks, followed by standardizing labels and doing hierarchical vision-language\nalignment to facilitate comprehensive coverage of gradually finer-grained\nsurgical tasks, from visual perception, temporal analysis, to high-level\nreasoning. Building upon this comprehensive dataset, we propose SurgVLM, which\nis built upon Qwen2.5-VL, and undergoes instruction tuning to 10+ surgical\ntasks.

This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both\nsemantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In\nthis work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework\nthat jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the\ninversion process.

We analyze the influence of Cosine and\nFFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a\nfocus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term\nmaneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates\nthat embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior\nclustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes,\noutperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion\nmodel guided by hyperspectral unmixing.

The unmixing\nautoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task\nfrom the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly\nreducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity.

Firstly, the ESS\nleverages the powerful visual perceptual understanding capabilities of the CLIP\nmodel to extract explicit semantic supervision, thereby enhancing semantic\nconsistency. Then, Considering that high-frequency information contributes to\nthe visual perception quality of images, in addition to the vanilla\ndistillation loss, the HFP loss guides the student model to restore the missing\nhigh-frequency details in degraded images that are critical for enhancing\nperceptual quality.

As SAIL's core, a frozen\npre-trained VLM collaborates with AdaptNet through a confidence-based\ninterpolation weight, generating robust predictions during inference. These\npredictions serve as self-supervised targets to align AdaptNet's outputs\nthrough efficient batch-wise processing, dramatically reducing computational\ncosts without modifying the VLM or requiring memory caches. To mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, we propose a\ngradient-aware reset strategy driven by a gradient drift indicator (GDI), which\ndynamically detects domain transitions and strategically resets AdaptNet for\nstable adaptation.

Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is recognized as a biomarker\nof secondary brain injury, with a significant linear correlation observed\nbetween optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and ICP.

Moreover, local SDFs are inherently incapable of\nrepresenting non-manifold geometry, leading to complete failure in such cases.\nTo address this gap, we propose MIND (Material Interface from Non-manifold\nDistance fields), a novel algorithm for generating material interfaces directly\nfrom UDFs, enabling non-manifold mesh extraction from a global perspective. The\ncore of our method lies in deriving a meaningful spatial partitioning from the\nUDF, where the target surface emerges as the interface between distinct\nregions. We begin by computing a two-signed local field to distinguish the two\nsides of manifold patches, and then extend this to a multi-labeled global field\ncapable of separating all sides of a non-manifold structure. By combining this\nmulti-labeled field with the input UDF, we construct material interfaces that\nsupport non-manifold mesh extraction via a multi-labeled Marching Cubes\nalgorithm. Extensive experiments on UDFs generated from diverse data sources,\nincluding point cloud reconstruction, multi-view reconstruction, and medial\naxis transforms, demonstrate that our approach robustly handles complex\nnon-manifold surfaces and significantly outperforms existing methods."}

Inspired\nby Self-Attention's insensitivity to token orders, we find an interesting\nphenomenon neglected in current works: disrupting the continuity of image\ntokens (i.e., making pixels not smoothly transited across patches) in ViT leads\nto a noticeable performance decline in the general (source) domain but only a\nmarginal decrease in downstream target domains. This questions the role of\nimage tokens' continuity in ViT's generalization under large domain gaps. In\nthis paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find\ncontinuity aids ViT in learning larger spatial patterns, which are harder to\ntransfer than smaller ones, enlarging domain distances.

Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards\nachieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context\nswitching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic\nforgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned\ntask when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task\ncontexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the\ninterference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper\nintroduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context\nswitching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an\nadditional network that generates the weights of the primary network\ndynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is\ninput-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer\nvision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of\npreviously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks,\nConvolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient\nDescent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding\ndynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in\nenabling continual learning for improved performance."}

This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of\nthe trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely\nattributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an\neffective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy\nclients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework,\nMaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem.
