Recent advances in artificial intelligence\n(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved\nthe precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations\nof manual identification.

A comprehensive survey of recent\nwork and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern\nAI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in\nspeed and accuracy.

Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation\nis more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex\nbody structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce\nDiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose\nestimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal\nreformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative\nframework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint\ngeneration, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global\nanatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific\nprompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via\ncross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints\nthroughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint\ndecoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving\nrobustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on\npublic animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization\ncapability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse\nspecies, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints."}

Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro.

Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig.

Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig\nused by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically\nmeaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting.

It is\nwell established that short range scores, given by $\\nabla_{x}\\log p(x_t)$, may\nprovide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying\nclean surface.

However,\nmost frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras\nmoving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically\nbiased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct\ncomparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging.\nIn this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built\ndense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches.\nWe evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view\nsynthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening.\nOur results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform\nclassical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually\nunderperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in\nsynthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms\nframe interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level."}

Although the development of\nadvanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in\nrecent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains\nan ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to\nprocess motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric\nfor evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality\nmetrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for\ninterpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based\non measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably\nwith these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient\n(x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then\nuse our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame\ninterpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual\npleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or\nSSIM."}

As\ntheir commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA\nsystems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital\ninteractions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research\ncommunity needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,\nlimitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive\nopen-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework\nconsists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human\ncomputer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use\ntask dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;\n(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs\nwith reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance\ngains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong\nperformance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an\naverage success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA\n(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across\ndomains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We\nrelease our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open\nfoundations for further CUA research."}

In this work, we present\nColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention\nmechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By\ndisentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention\nmaps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color\nediting, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method\nmodifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated\nareas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate\nthat ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.\nFurthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1\nKontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended\nto video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,\nparticularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,\nour method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such\nas Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility."}
