Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic\ncausal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like\nmanipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object\nconcept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of\nwell-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke\nsegments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual\nworld models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet\nsupports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the\nmotion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)\nthe expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.\nThese concepts are used for \"statistical counterfactual probing\", where diverse\n\"virtual pokes\" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the\nresultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as\nstatistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet\noutperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.\nFinally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream\napplications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for\nphysical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object\nmanipulation models."}

In this work, we find\nthat existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic\ninformation to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find\nCNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,\ne.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the\nhigh-frequency space also improves transferability.

However, further enhancing existing MLLMs\nnecessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task\ncomplexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent\nself-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible\nsolution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods\naugment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data\ncomplexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual\ndescriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,\nleading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched\ndifficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,\nclosed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data\nand model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,\nC2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model\nevolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex\nmultimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with\niteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively\nselects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to\nconduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.\nConsequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and\nconsistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be\nreleased."}

Under review", "summary": "Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters,\ntext-to-image (T2I) generative models are still susceptible to producing\nharmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious\nconcerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which\naims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs\nfrom the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential\nexternal safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly\nrecognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before\nreal-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often\ntreat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which\nlimits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this\ngap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to\nautomatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.\nUnlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly\nmodels the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic\nprompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and\ndiversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve\nthis without direct access to representative training samples, we draw\ninspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple\nand tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient\noptimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long\nand potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is\nvalidated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9\nstate-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I\nmodels and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity."}
