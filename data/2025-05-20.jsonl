Although recent deep architectures and large-scale datasets have\ndriven impressive closed-set performance, these models struggle to recognize or\nproperly segment objects outside their training classes. This gap has sparked\ninterest in Open-Set Semantic Segmentation (O3S), where models must both\ncorrectly label known categories and detect novel, unseen classes. In this\npaper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the\nsegmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel\nregularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that\nmaximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned\non each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages\nthe encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the\nnetwork's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories.\nExperimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting\nunseen objects. We further outline future directions for dynamic open-world\nadaptation and efficient information-theoretic estimation."}

Successful\ndetection represents the object's visibility at the corresponding SVI location.\nFurther, a heterogeneous visibility graph is constructed to address the complex\ninteraction between observers and target objects. In the first case study, the\nmethod proves its reliability in detecting the visibility of six tall landmark\nconstructions in global cities, with an overall accuracy of 87%. Furthermore,\nit reveals broader contextual differences when the landmarks are perceived and\nexperienced. In the second case, the proposed visibility graph uncovers the\nform and strength of connections for multiple landmarks along the River Thames\nin London, as well as the places where these connections occur. Notably,\nbridges on the River Thames account for approximately 30% of total connections.\nOur method complements and enhances traditional LoS-based visibility analysis,\nand showcases the possibility of revealing the prevalent connection of any\nvisual objects in the urban environment. It opens up new research perspectives\nfor urban planning, heritage conservation, and computational social science."}

However, existing deep\nlearning-based whale detection methods usually require manually created,\nhigh-quality bounding box annotations, which are labor-intensive to produce.\nMoreover, existing studies often exclude ``uncertain whales'', individuals that\nhave ambiguous appearances in satellite imagery, limiting the applicability of\nthese models in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this study\nintroduces an automated pipeline for detecting beluga whales and harp seals in\nVHR satellite imagery. The pipeline leverages point annotations and the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) to generate precise bounding box annotations, which are\nused to train YOLOv8 for multiclass detection of certain whales, uncertain\nwhales, and harp seals. Experimental results demonstrated that SAM-generated\nannotations significantly improved detection performance, achieving higher\n$\\text{F}_\\text{1}$-scores compared to traditional buffer-based annotations.\nYOLOv8 trained on SAM-labeled boxes achieved an overall\n$\\text{F}_\\text{1}$-score of 72.2% for whales overall and 70.3% for harp seals,\nwith superior performance in dense scenes. The proposed approach not only\nreduces the manual effort required for annotation but also enhances the\ndetection of uncertain whales, offering a more comprehensive solution for\nmarine animal monitoring.

To address these issues, we\ninvestigate a simple yet powerful vision task Adaptor for Mamba models, which\nconsists of two functional modules: Adaptor-T and Adaptor-S. When solving the\nhidden states for SSM, we apply a lightweight prediction module Adaptor-T to\nselect a set of learnable locations as memory augmentations to ease long-range\nforgetting issues. Moreover, we leverage Adapator-S, composed of multi-scale\ndilated convolutional kernels, to enhance the spatial modeling and introduce\nthe image inductive bias into the feature output. Both modules can enlarge the\ncontext modeling in casual computing, as the output is enhanced by the\ninaccessible features.

Experiments on four TarFlow\nmodels demonstrate that GS-Jacobi sampling can significantly enhance sampling\nefficiency while maintaining the quality of generated images (measured by FID),\nachieving speed-ups of 4.53x in Img128cond, 5.32x in AFHQ, 2.96x in\nImg64uncond, and 2.51x in Img64cond without degrading FID scores or sample\nquality.

It incorporates a cross-modal feature fusion module that assigns\npixel-wise image features to 3D input point clouds to enhance learned 3D point\nfeatures, and integrates patch-wise image features with superpoint features to\nimprove the quality of coarse matching. This is followed by a coarse-to-fine\nmatching module that accurately establishes correspondences using the fused\nfeatures. We extensively evaluate CoFF on four common datasets: 3DMatch,\n3DLoMatch, IndoorLRS, and the recently released ScanNet++ datasets. In\naddition, we assess CoFF on specific subset datasets containing geometrically\nambiguous cases. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoFF achieves\nstate-of-the-art registration performance across all benchmarks, including\nremarkable registration recalls of 95.9% and 81.6% on the widely-used 3DMatch\nand 3DLoMatch datasets, respectively...(Truncated to fit arXiv abstract length)"}

Therefore, towards robust complex\nreal-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by\nadditional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced\nframework for VAD: \"PI-VAD\", a novel approach that augments RGB representations\nby five additional modalities.

Recent\nadvances primarily build Birds-Eye-View (BEV) feature from front-view (FV)\nimages to perceive 3D information of Lane more effectively.

Both modules adaptively learn the two fundamental components of\nconvolution operations: offsets and weights conditioned on motion-sensitive\nevent streams. In the encoder, EMA leverages events to modulate the sampling\npositions of RGB-D features to achieve pixel redistribution for improved\nalignment and fusion. In the decoder, LDF refines depth estimations around\nmoving objects by learning motion-aware masks from events.

Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states\nusing zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing\nweights during forward passes to identify gradient directions.
