The need\nfor human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines\nhave achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the\nright decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help\nof deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence\ntechnologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the\ndevelopment of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In\nthis work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene\nunderstanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to\ninvestigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of\nseveral Backbones as encoders for models.

This leads to the low generation quality\nof the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,\nexisting methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding\nannotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in\nsupervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.\nThe method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation\nof paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional\ndiffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices\nand mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training\nprocess of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show\nthat our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.\nMoreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus\nenhancing the performance of downstream tasks."}

However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise\nand outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the\neffectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind\nPnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated\nblind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high\ncomputational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of\nminimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called\nMinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task\nlearning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the\nexisting I2P registration architectures.

In\ntraining, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank\nfactorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.\nThese features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves\nshared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.\nSubsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI\nclass and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction\nrepresentations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight\nadaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show\nthat our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on\nHICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/ChelsieLei/HOLa."}

Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information\nseparately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately\nrepresent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to\ntemporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature\nextraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and\nvideo understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video\nrepresentation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce\na set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas\ncontaining fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature\nextraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the\nfine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions.

Yet, existing methods face a critical challenge in\nbalancing accuracy and computational efficiency: uniform frame sampling methods\nensure content coverage but incur prohibitive computational costs, while\nsalient-frame sampling methods reduce overhead but suffer from query-agnostic\nframe selection that biases retrieval results. To address this, we propose\nProCLIP, a user-centric framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with\nsignificantly improved efficiency.

Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning\nand code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their\nadvantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal\ndata type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in\ncomplex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic\ndata synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning\ndata covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of\nreasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the\ntypical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft\nreward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity\nin the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks\nand self-built chart reasoning dataset (\\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental\nresults show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain\nmethods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\\emph{e.g.,\nGPT-4o, Claude-3.5})."}

The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization.

We build on recent advances in foveated image\nprocessing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both\nhuman head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA\nrobot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously\ncollecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as\nwell as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that\nincorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data.
