However,\ntraditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on\nGaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them\nunsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like\nORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint\nrepeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a\nphysics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to\nSHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to\nconstruct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based\nhomography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction\nwithout the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The\nmethod is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via\nhandheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow\ninterference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared\nto classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine\nlength errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while\nmaintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,\ninterpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable\ndeployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space\nmodeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically\ngrounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack\nevolution."}

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by\n31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,\ncompared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting\nresults."}

A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster.

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess.

In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video\nobject detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.\nFirst, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,\nwe can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with\ndiverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in\nthe training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all\npossible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual\nproblems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing\nduring inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as\nfully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating\nimage-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video\nobject, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale\neffortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the\nlength of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even\ngeneralizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire\nvideo. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector\non several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with\nstrong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We\nalso compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is\ncompetitive with the current state of the art even with the computational\nbottleneck.

A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment\nof spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images\nthat reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input\nprompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework\nfor modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging\nthe concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we\nmake two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,\nPoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D\nspatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human\njudgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time\nmethod that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I\nmodels without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based\nreward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a\ngradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during\nthe denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of\ninitial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to\ntraditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure\nof complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment.

Conventional object\ndetection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's\nability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nobjects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to\ndetect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous\nsituations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection\napproach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification\nto object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their\nspecific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'\nbased on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object\nposition relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can\neffectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer\nreal-time decisions.

While various sparse attention methods have been\nproposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not\noptimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video\ndata when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block\nAttention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for\nVDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within\npre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,\nvarying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA\nenhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a\nlayer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to\ndiverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global\nblock selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions\nacross an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to\ndynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative\nsimilarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly\naccelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and\n1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation\nquality to full attention.

By performing low-rank factorization in the\nwavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA\nobtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution\nanalysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while\nproviding greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.\nThrough comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA\nperforms superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,\nclassification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated\nimage quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was\nprimarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in\nlanguage tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.\nThe code is publicly available at\n\\href{GitHub}{https://github.com/moeinheidari7829/WaRA}."}

Current approaches extract the surface through costly\npost-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or\nrequiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of\nvertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to\na surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all\ngeometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel\nGaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and\nsurface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D\nGaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the\nmesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration\ndirectly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities\noptimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical\ncontributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both\nrepresentations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying\ngeometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each\ntraining iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay\ntriangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D\nGaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric\nerosion.

Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized\nfor instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We\nthen embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets\nconstruct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth\ndistortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For\nopen-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D\npoint clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with\nhigh-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D\ninstance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object\nlocalization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies.

Experiments on various datasets,\nincluding the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and\nDVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and\ncomputation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our\nSEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\\times$ lower bit\nbudgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be fully\nopen-sourced."}

To circumvent\nthese costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated\nimages as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a\nvaluable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when\nthese images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable\ndetection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable\nin the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.\nWe analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion\nmodels (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing\nwatermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are\neither erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the\nnoising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,\ndespite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and\nefficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To\novercome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for\nIARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in\nlarge language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm.

The model are then used to\nrender each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid\nframe cropping.

These problems hinder fair comparisons\nbetween TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7\nonline TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates\nthem across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on\nCLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid\nloss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA\nto assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates\nvarious evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,\nout-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic\nassessment of TTA methods.
