Model quantization, particularly to low\nbit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods\nexhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,\nwhile QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational\ncosts, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and\nlacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel\nframework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is\nfounded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation\nquantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization\n``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential\n``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32\nwhile quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to\nkeep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2\nquantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than\nexisting QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32\ntraining, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with\nFP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse\ndownstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object\ndetection.

As video frame rates continue\nto increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the\nlimitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,\nwhich are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)\ndemands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable\nsolution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between\nhyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a\ncompression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational\ncomplexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal\ninformation across frames.

This task becomes\nparticularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,\nyielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in\nthis setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between\nvariable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method\nspecifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,\nleveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations\nthat capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations\nonto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal\nparameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.\nWe evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and\nan agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers\nparameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method\nto real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both\ntheorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex\nstochastic pattern formation."}
