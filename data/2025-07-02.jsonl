While\nexisting methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with\nlong-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video\ncontent, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly\nused. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of\ncrucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar\nframes. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions\naccurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video\nsegments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model\nto guide the frame sampling process. We propose \"moment sampling\", a novel,\nmodel-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant\nframes according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a\nlightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing\non the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances\nlong-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on\nfour long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

This is\nespecially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by\nperiodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains\nvaluable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer\nsome mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical\ndata for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply\nstoring and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating\nall historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying\nrelevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model\nupdate algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these\nlimitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a\nFirst-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based\nExperience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target\ndomains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar\nto the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates\nthe retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also\npreventing overfitting to the new domain.

Prior works have\naddressed the in-frame target localization problem with data-driven approaches\nby carefully removing out-of-frame samples. Vision-based gaze estimation\nmethods, such as OpenFace, do not effectively absorb background information in\nimages and cannot predict gaze target in situations where subjects look away\nfrom the camera. In this work, we propose a system to address the problem of\n360-degree gaze target estimation from an image in generalized visual scenes.\nThe system, named GazeTarget360, integrates conditional inference engines of an\neye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion\ndecoder. Cross validation results show that GazeTarget360 can produce accurate\nand reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios. This makes a\nfirst-of-its-kind system to predict gaze targets from realistic camera footage\nwhich is highly efficient and deployable.

To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that\nrequires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding,\nenabling efficient real-time deployment.

At present, few advanced\nmodels can perform multi-organ or multi-disease segmentation, offering greater\nflexibility. Also, recently, prompt-based image segmentation has gained\nattention as a more flexible approach. It allows models to segment areas based\non user-provided prompts. Despite these advances, there has been no dedicated\nwork on prompt-based interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation,\nespecially for Chest X-rays. This work presents two main contributions: first,\ngenerating doodle prompts by medical experts of a collection of datasets from\nmultiple sources with 23 classes, including 6 organs and 17 diseases,\nspecifically designed for prompt-based Chest X-ray segmentation. Second, we\nintroduce Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for accurately segmenting multiple\norgans and diseases from Chest X-rays. The model incorporates multi-stage\nfeature fusion, enabling it to combine features from various network layers for\nbetter spatial and semantic understanding, enhancing segmentation accuracy.\nCompared to existing pre-trained models for prompt-based image segmentation,\nour model scores well, providing a reliable solution for segmenting Chest\nX-rays based on user prompts."}

However, most classifier guidance approaches are restricted to robust\nclassifiers, which were specifically trained on the noise of the diffusion\nforward process. We extend classifier guidance to work with general,\nnon-robust, classifiers that were trained without noise. We analyze the\nsensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion\nprocess on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set\nand the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set. Our findings reveal\nthat non-robust classifiers exhibit significant accuracy degradation under\nnoisy conditions, leading to unstable guidance gradients. To mitigate these\nissues, we propose a method that utilizes one-step denoised image predictions\nand implements stabilization techniques inspired by stochastic optimization\nmethods, such as exponential moving averages. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our approach improves the stability of classifier guidance while\nmaintaining sample diversity and visual quality.

Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D\nconvolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with\n1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143\nheld-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and\ncavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible\nFPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3)\nvein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more\nthan artery masks.
