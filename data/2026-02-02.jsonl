A Comparative Evaluation", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.RO"], "comment": null, "summary": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables zero-shot recognition of novel categories through vision-language models, achieving strong performance on natural images. However, transferability to aerial imagery remains unexplored. We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck. Prompt engineering strategies such as domain-specific prefixing and synonym expansion, fail to provide meaningful performance gains. Performance varies dramatically across datasets (F1: 0.53 on DIOR, 0.12 on FAIR1M), exposing brittleness to imaging conditions. These findings establish baseline expectations and highlight the need for domain-adaptive approaches in aerial OVD."}

However, most VQA datasets focus on real-world images or simple diagrammatic analysis, with few focused on interpreting complex scientific charts. Indeed, many VQA datasets that analyze charts do not contain the underlying data behind those charts or assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. In reality, charts are transformations (i.e. analysis, simplification, modification) of data. This distinction introduces a reasoning challenge in VQA that the current datasets do not capture. In this paper, we argue for a dedicated VQA benchmark for scientific charts where there is no 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. To do so, we survey existing VQA datasets and highlight limitations of the current field. We then generate synthetic histogram charts based on ground truth data, and ask both humans and a large reasoning model questions where precise answers depend on access to the underlying data. We release the open-source dataset, including figures, underlying data, distribution parameters used to generate the data, and bounding boxes for all figure marks and text for future research."}

We introduce VRRPI-Bench, a benchmark derived from unlabeled egocentric videos with verbalized annotations of relative camera motion, reflecting realistic scenarios with simultaneous translation and rotation around a shared object. We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom. Despite the simplicity of RCPE, most VLMs fail to generalize beyond shallow 2D heuristics, particularly for depth changes and roll transformations along the optical axis. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 ($0.64$) fall short of classic geometric baselines ($0.97$) and human performance ($0.92$).

Code available at : https://github.com/wiskott-lab/single-vs-hier-recon", "summary": "Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions."}

Accordingly, we propose VMonarch, a novel attention mechanism for Video DiTs that enables efficient computation over the dynamic sparse patterns with structured Monarch matrices.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMonarch achieves comparable or superior generation quality to full attention on VBench after minimal tuning. It overcomes the attention bottleneck in Video DiTs, reduces attention FLOPs by a factor of 17.5, and achieves a speedup of over 5x in attention computation for long videos, surpassing state-of-the-art sparse attention methods at 90% sparsity."}

Our approach uses coarse 3D renderings to explicitly control scene layout, camera motion, and human trajectories, while a learned neural renderer generates realistic appearance, lighting, and fine-scale dynamics guided by text prompts.

Our key innovation eliminates explicit geometric projections by using a geometry-aware foundation model with cross-frame attention to implicitly encode 3D scene understanding in feature space. FlexMap features two core components: a spatial-temporal enhancement module that separates cross-view spatial reasoning from temporal dynamics, and a camera-aware decoder with latent camera tokens, enabling view-adaptive attention without the need for projection matrices. Experiments demonstrate that FlexMap outperforms existing methods across multiple configurations while maintaining robustness to missing views and sensor variations, enabling more practical real-world deployment."}

However, the clinical implementation and trust of multi-view markerless motion capture (MMMC) require that, in addition to being accurate, these systems produce reliable confidence intervals to indicate how accurate they are for any individual. Building on our prior work utilizing variational inference to estimate joint angle posterior distributions, this study evaluates the calibration and reliability of a probabilistic MMMC method. We analyzed data from 68 participants across two institutions, validating the model against an instrumented walkway and standard marker-based motion capture. We measured the calibration of the confidence intervals using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The model demonstrated reliable calibration, yielding ECE values generally < 0.1 for both step and stride length and bias-corrected gait kinematics. We observed a median step and stride length error of ~16 mm and ~12 mm respectively, with median bias-corrected kinematic errors ranging from 1.5 to 3.8 degrees across lower extremity joints. Consistent with the calibrated ECE, the magnitude of the model's predicted uncertainty correlated strongly with observed error measures. These findings indicate that, as designed, the probabilistic model reconstruction quantifies epistemic uncertainty, allowing it to identify unreliable outputs without the need for concurrent ground-truth instrumentation."}

Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods. This result highlights a novel path towards mitigating hallucination by unlocking the inherent potential within LVLMs themselves."}

To address these issues, we propose ScribbleSense, an editing method that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models to effectively resolve these challenges. We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles. Once the semantic intent of the scribble is discerned, we employ globally generated images to extract local texture details, thereby anchoring local semantics and alleviating ambiguities concerning the target semantic locations.

Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity. These results establish representation-informed diffusion sampling as a practical strategy for reinforcing semantic preservation and image consistency."}

More recently, three-dimensional point cloud data have attracted increasing interest due to their ability to represent richer geometric characteristics of animal morphology, but direct head-to-head comparisons with depth image-based approaches remain limited. In this study, we compared top-view depth image and point cloud data for BCS prediction under four settings: 1) unsegmented raw data, 2) segmented full-body data, 3) segmented hindquarter data, and 4) handcrafted feature data. Prediction models were evaluated using data from 1,020 dairy cows collected on a commercial farm, with cow-level cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Depth image-based models consistently achieved higher accuracy than point cloud-based models when unsegmented raw data and segmented full-body data were used, whereas comparable performance was observed when segmented hindquarter data were used. Both depth image and point cloud approaches showed reduced accuracy when handcrafted feature data were employed compared with the other settings. Overall, point cloud-based predictions were more sensitive to noise and model architecture than depth image-based predictions.

However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model."}

They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin.

In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks.

To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement. Then, to further enhance point cloud feature representation, we propose a dynamic channel gating mechanism that leverages learnable channel-wise weighting. This mechanism adaptively optimizes features generated by the sparse 3D U-Net network, significantly enhancing key geometric information.

Existing methods achieve this attribution goal by training models using annotated pairs of synthetic images and their original training sources. However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment. By formulating this observation as a theoretical assumption on cross-covariance, we provide a theoretical explanation of how alignment and disentanglement can approximate the concept-matching process through a decomposition of the canonical correlation analysis objective. On the real-world benchmarks, AbC, we show that our unsupervised method surprisingly outperforms the supervised methods. As a starting point, we expect our intuitive insights and experimental findings to provide a fresh perspective on this challenging task."}

Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding."}

To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot OOV detector (OOVDet), a novel framework that effectively detects predefined classes while reliably rejecting undefined ones in zero-shot scenes. Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption.\n  Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes.

Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation.

We contend that these overlooked statistics, particularly channel-wise variance and dominant (maximum) activations, are highly discriminative for OOD detection. We introduce DAVIS, a simple and broadly applicable post-hoc technique that enriches feature vectors by incorporating these crucial statistics, directly addressing the information loss from GAP.

Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the two versions of ImgCoT."}

RAD is a training-free approach that stores anomaly-free features in a memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, matching test patches against the memory.

On one hand, multi-date approaches using NeRF or Gaussian-splatting jointly model appearance and geometry across many acquisitions, achieving accurate reconstructions on opportunistic imagery with numerous observations. On the other hand, classical stereoscopic reconstruction pipelines deliver robust and scalable results for simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous image pairs. However, when the two images are captured months apart, strong seasonal, illumination, and shadow changes violate standard stereoscopic assumptions, causing existing pipelines to fail. This work presents the first Diachronic Stereo Matching method for satellite imagery, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction from temporally distant pairs. Two advances make this possible: (1) fine-tuning a state-of-the-art deep stereo network that leverages monocular depth priors, and (2) exposing it to a dataset specifically curated to include a diverse set of diachronic image pairs. In particular, we start from a pretrained MonSter model, trained initially on a mix of synthetic and real datasets such as SceneFlow and KITTI, and fine-tune it on a set of stereo pairs derived from the DFC2019 remote sensing challenge. This dataset contains both synchronic and diachronic pairs under diverse seasonal and illumination conditions. Experiments on multi-date WorldView-3 imagery demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses classical pipelines and unadapted deep stereo models on both synchronic and diachronic settings. Fine-tuning on temporally diverse images, together with monocular priors, proves essential for enabling 3D reconstruction from previously incompatible acquisition dates.

Consequently, their reasoning capability is limited when dealing with complex scenes characterized by ambiguity and visual uncertainty. In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FarmMind achieves superior segmentation performance and stronger generalization ability compared with existing methods.

To address this, we propose native visual tokenization, which enforces causal dependencies during tokenization. Building on this idea, we introduce NativeTok, a framework that achieves efficient reconstruction while embedding relational constraints within token sequences. NativeTok consists of: (1) a Meta Image Transformer (MIT) for latent image modeling, and (2) a Mixture of Causal Expert Transformer (MoCET), where each lightweight expert block generates a single token conditioned on prior tokens and latent features.

However, the direct transfer of scaling assumptions from CV to RS has not been adequately examined. We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models. In addition, through the explained variance ratio and the feature correlation analysis, we provide mechanistic explanations showing that RS FMs distribute task-relevant information with high redundancy. Our findings establish post-hoc slimmability as both a practical deployment strategy for resource-constrained environments and a diagnostic tool that challenges the prevailing scaling paradigm in RS.

To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample.

Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning.

To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM. Notably, our Riemannian Flow Matching-based DiT exhibits efficient convergence, achieving a gFID of 3.47 at 80 epochs."}

Preprint version; the final camera-ready version may differ", "summary": "Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves strong detection and localization performance, interpretability, and robustness under various levels of data contamination."}

In practice, acquiring these distances depends on labour-intensive manual interpretation of animal observations across large camera trap video corpora. This study introduces and evaluates an only sparsely explored alternative: the integration of computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) pipelines directly into ecological camera trap workflows for great ape conservation. Using a real-world dataset of 220 camera trap videos documenting a wild chimpanzee population, we combine two MDE models, Dense Prediction Transformers and Depth Anything, with multiple distance sampling strategies. These components are used to generate detection distance estimates, from which population density and abundance are inferred. Comparative analysis against manually derived ground-truth distances shows that calibrated DPT consistently outperforms Depth Anything. This advantage is observed in both distance estimation accuracy and downstream density and abundance inference. Nevertheless, both models exhibit systematic biases. We show that, given complex forest environments, they tend to overestimate detection distances and consequently underestimate density and abundance relative to conventional manual approaches. We further find that failures in animal detection across distance ranges are a primary factor limiting estimation accuracy. Overall, this work provides a case study that shows MDE-driven camera trap distance sampling is a viable and practical alternative to manual distance estimation. The proposed approach yields population estimates within 22% of those obtained using traditional methods."}

Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Hawkeye outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes better across multiple datasets. The code and models will be made available."}

We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1"}

Its first stage, Frame-Level Budgeting, identifies keyframes by evaluating their visual dynamics and relevance, generating a strategic prior based on their importance scores. Guided by this prior, the second stage, Token-Level Budgeting, allocates tokens in two phases: it first secures high-relevance Core Tokens, followed by diverse Context Tokens selected with an efficient batched Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Triage improves inference speed and reduces memory footprint, while maintaining or surpassing the performance of baselines and other methods on various video reasoning benchmarks."}

Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality. Future work will investigate the relationship between confidence thresholds and recognition performance."}

To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes. Furthermore, to enhance both accuracy and efficiency, we introduce a multi-resolution training strategy that jointly optimizes Gaussian parameters and spatial transformations across different resolution levels. Experiments show that GaussianSVR outperforms the baseline methods on fetal MR volumetric reconstruction. Code will be available upon acceptance."}

This improves upon label sampling strategies, where models are trained on mixed annotations, and offers a more principled way to capture inter-rater variability. Experiments on a colorectal organoid dataset annotated by two experts demonstrate that our rater-specific ensemble strategy improves calibration performance while maintaining comparable detection accuracy. These findings suggest that explicitly modelling rater disagreement can lead to more trustworthy object detectors in biomedical imaging."}

We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance.

Specifically, each point cloud is represented as a compact combination of class-specific prototypes that capture shared semantic structure, while adversarial perturbations are optimized within a low-rank subspace to induce coherent and architecture-agnostic variations. This design suppresses model-dependent noise and constrains perturbations to semantically meaningful directions, thereby improving cross-model transferability without relying on surrogate-specific artifacts.

We introduce FlowCalib, the first framework that detects LiDAR-to-vehicle miscalibration using motion cues from the scene flow of static objects. Our approach leverages the systematic bias induced by rotational misalignment in the flow field generated from sequential 3D point clouds, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The architecture integrates a neural scene flow prior for flow estimation and incorporates a dual-branch detection network that fuses learned global flow features with handcrafted geometric descriptors. These combined representations allow the system to perform two complementary binary classification tasks: a global binary decision indicating whether misalignment is present and separate, axis-specific binary decisions indicating whether each rotational axis is misaligned. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate FlowCalib's ability to robustly detect miscalibration, establishing a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle miscalibration detection."}

However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability.

Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts. Experiments across diverse datasets show that TaTa significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization."}

To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments."}

Under practical imaging conditions, object detection systems often face challenges such as large scale variations caused by varying camera distances, severe occlusion from plant structures, and highly imbalanced class distributions. These factors make conventional object detection approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets difficult to simultaneously achieve high detection accuracy and deployment efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes an active learning driven lightweight object detection framework, integrating data analysis, model design, and training strategy. First, the size distribution of objects in raw agricultural images is analyzed to redefine an operational target range, thereby improving learning stability under real-world conditions. Second, an efficient feature extraction module is incorporated to reduce computational cost, while a lightweight attention mechanism is introduced to enhance feature representation under multi-scale and occluded scenarios. Finally, an active learning strategy is employed to iteratively select high-information samples for annotation and training under a limited labeling budget, effectively improving the recognition performance of minority and small-object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that, while maintaining a low parameter count and inference cost suitable for edge-device deployment, the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of tomatoes and tomato flowers in raw images. Under limited annotation conditions, the framework achieves an overall detection accuracy of 67.8% mAP, validating its practicality and feasibility for intelligent agricultural applications."}

Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators. The merged LoRAs retain less weights and incur no inference latency, making our method computationally lightweight."}

We propose an unsupervised Domain-Invariant Visual Enhancement and Restoration (DIVER) framework that integrates empirical correction with physics-guided modeling for robust underwater image enhancement. DIVER first applies either IlluminateNet for adaptive luminance enhancement or a Spectral Equalization Filter for spectral normalization. An Adaptive Optical Correction Module then refines hue and contrast using channel-adaptive filtering, while Hydro-OpticNet employs physics-constrained learning to compensate for backscatter and wavelength-dependent attenuation. The parameters of IlluminateNet and Hydro-OpticNet are optimized via unsupervised learning using a composite loss function. DIVER is evaluated on eight diverse datasets covering shallow, deep, and highly turbid environments, including both naturally low-light and artificially illuminated scenes, using reference and non-reference metrics. While state-of-the-art methods such as WaterNet, UDNet, and Phaseformer perform reasonably in shallow water, their performance degrades in deep, unevenly illuminated, or artificially lit conditions. In contrast, DIVER consistently achieves best or near-best performance across all datasets, demonstrating strong domain-invariant capability. DIVER yields at least a 9% improvement over SOTA methods in UCIQE. On the low-light SeaThru dataset, where color-palette references enable direct evaluation of color restoration, DIVER achieves at least a 4.9% reduction in GPMAE compared to existing methods. Beyond visual quality, DIVER also improves robotic perception by enhancing ORB-based keypoint repeatability and matching performance, confirming its robustness across diverse underwater environments."}

However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of \"memory-dense\" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets."}

Together, these components enhance the network's ability to distinguish true structure from wrapping artifacts, yielding state-of-the-art performance across perceptual and linear HDR quality metrics."}

In contrast, physically based inverse rendering relies on mesh representations and path tracing, which enforce correct light transport but place strong requirements on geometric fidelity, becoming a practical bottleneck for real indoor scenes. In this work, we propose Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing (EAG-PT), aiming for physically based light transport with a unified 2D Gaussian representation. Our design is based on three cores: (1) using 2D Gaussians as a unified scene representation and transport-friendly geometry proxy that avoids reconstructed mesh, (2) explicitly separating emissive and non-emissive components during reconstruction for further scene editing, and (3) decoupling reconstruction from final rendering by using efficient single-bounce optimization and high-quality multi-bounce path tracing after scene editing. Experiments on synthetic and real indoor scenes show that EAG-PT produces more natural and physically consistent renders after editing than radiant scene reconstructions, while preserving finer geometric detail and avoiding mesh-induced artifacts compared to mesh-based inverse path tracing. These results suggest promising directions for future use in interior design, XR content creation, and embodied AI."}

While standard pipelines treat these tasks in isolation, our core insight is that they are fundamentally synergistic: restoration provides clean anatomical structures to improve segmentation, while semantic priors regularize the restoration process. VL-DUN resolves the sub-optimality of sequential processing through two primary innovations. (1) We formulate AiOMIRS as a unified optimization problem, deriving an interpretable joint unfolding mechanism where restoration and segmentation are mathematically coupled for mutual refinement. (2) We introduce a frequency-aware Mamba mechanism to capture long-range dependencies for global segmentation while preserving the high-frequency textures necessary for restoration. This allows for efficient global context modeling with linear complexity, effectively mitigating the spectral bias of standard architectures. As a pioneering work in the AiOMIRS task, VL-DUN establishes a new state-of-the-art across multi-modal benchmarks, improving PSNR by 0.92 dB and the Dice coefficient by 9.76\\%. Our results demonstrate that joint collaborative learning offers a superior, more robust solution for complex clinical workflows compared to isolated task processing.

However, these approaches typically utilize a diffusion prior trained at a single scale, ignoring the hierarchical scale structure of image data. In this work, we propose to decompose images into Laplacian pyramid scales and train separate diffusion priors for each frequency band. We then develop an algorithm to perform super-resolution that utilizes these priors to progressively refine reconstructions across different scales. Evaluated on brain, knee, and prostate MRI data, our approach both improves perceptual quality over baselines and reduces inference time through smaller coarse-scale networks. Our framework unifies multiscale reconstruction and diffusion priors for medical image super-resolution."}

Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we average multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning. We further introduce a real-world dataset across multi-bands acquired with two twin ground-based telescopes, providing paired raw frames and instrument-pipeline calibrated frames, together with calibration data and stacked high-SNR bases for real-world evaluation."}
