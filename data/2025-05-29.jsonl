To address these limitations,\nwe introduce EPiC, an efficient and precise camera control learning framework\nthat automatically constructs high-quality anchor videos without expensive\ncamera trajectory annotations. Concretely, we create highly precise anchor\nvideos for training by masking source videos based on first-frame visibility.\nThis approach ensures high alignment, eliminates the need for camera trajectory\nannotations, and thus can be readily applied to any in-the-wild video to\ngenerate image-to-video (I2V) training pairs. Furthermore, we introduce\nAnchor-ControlNet, a lightweight conditioning module that integrates anchor\nvideo guidance in visible regions to pretrained VDMs, with less than 1% of\nbackbone model parameters.

Recent\nstudies have introduced direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance the\nalignment of these models. However, the effectiveness of DPO is constrained by\nthe issue of visual inconsistency, where the significant visual disparity\nbetween well-aligned and poorly-aligned images prevents diffusion models from\nidentifying which factors contribute positively to alignment during\nfine-tuning. To address this issue, this paper introduces D-Fusion, a method to\nconstruct DPO-trainable visually consistent samples. On one hand, by performing\nmask-guided self-attention fusion, the resulting images are not only\nwell-aligned, but also visually consistent with given poorly-aligned images. On\nthe other hand, D-Fusion can retain the denoising trajectories of the resulting\nimages, which are essential for DPO training. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of D-Fusion in improving prompt-image alignment when applied\nto different reinforcement learning algorithms."}

However, this approach suffers from error\npropagation, particularly in distant future frames. To address this limitation,\nthis paper proposes the first AutoRegression-Free (ARFree) video prediction\nframework using diffusion models. Different from an autoregressive video\nprediction mechanism, ARFree directly predicts any future frame tuples from the\ncontext frame tuple. The proposed ARFree consists of two key components: 1) a\nmotion prediction module that predicts a future motion using motion feature\nextracted from the context frame tuple; 2) a training method that improves\nmotion continuity and contextual consistency between adjacent future frame\ntuples. Our experiments with two benchmark datasets show that the proposed\nARFree video prediction framework outperforms several state-of-the-art video\nprediction methods."}

However, existing\nZSAD research has shown limitations by either not considering domain adaptation\nof general-purpose backbone models to anomaly detection domains or by\nimplementing only partial adaptation to some model components. In this paper,\nwe propose HeadCLIP to overcome these limitations by effectively adapting both\ntext and image encoders to the domain. HeadCLIP generalizes the concepts of\nnormality and abnormality through learnable prompts in the text encoder, and\nintroduces learnable head weights to the image encoder to dynamically adjust\nthe features held by each attention head according to domain characteristics.\nAdditionally, we maximize the effect of domain adaptation by introducing a\njoint anomaly score that utilizes domain-adapted pixel-level information for\nimage-level anomaly detection.

In this paper, we present VTV-LLM, the first multi-modal large\nlanguage model for universal Visuo-Tactile Video (VTV) understanding that\nbridges the gap between tactile perception and natural language. To address the\nchallenges of cross-sensor and cross-modal integration, we contribute VTV150K,\na comprehensive dataset comprising 150,000 video frames from 100 diverse\nobjects captured across three different tactile sensors (GelSight Mini, DIGIT,\nand Tac3D), annotated with four fundamental tactile attributes (hardness,\nprotrusion, elasticity, and friction). We develop a novel three-stage training\nparadigm that includes VTV enhancement for robust visuo-tactile representation,\nVTV-text alignment for cross-modal correspondence, and text prompt finetuning\nfor natural language generation. Our framework enables sophisticated tactile\nreasoning capabilities including feature assessment, comparative analysis,\nscenario-based decision making and so on. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthat VTV-LLM achieves superior performance in tactile video understanding\ntasks, establishing a foundation for more intuitive human-machine interaction\nin tactile domains."}

For unpaired kernels,\nharmonization eliminates confounding differences in emphysema (p>0.05). High\nDice scores confirm preservation of muscle and fat anatomy, while lung vessel\noverlap remains reasonable. Overall, our shared latent space multipath cycleGAN\nenables robust harmonization across paired and unpaired CT kernels, improving\nemphysema quantification and preserving anatomical fidelity."}

Here, we compare the performance of two machine\nlearning models - FMCIB+XGBoost, a supervised model with domain-specific\npretraining, and Dinov2+ABMIL, a self-supervised model with attention-based\nmultiple-instance learning - on 3D lung nodule data from the Stanford\nRadiogenomics and Lung-CT-PT-Dx cohorts. In the task of KRAS and EGFR mutation\ndetection, FMCIB+XGBoost consistently outperformed Dinov2+ABMIL, achieving\naccuracies of 0.846 and 0.883 for KRAS and EGFR mutations, respectively. In\ncancer staging, Dinov2+ABMIL demonstrated competitive generalization, achieving\nan accuracy of 0.797 for T-stage prediction in the Lung-CT-PT-Dx cohort,\nsuggesting SSL's adaptability across diverse datasets.

We introduce\nChain-of-Talkers (CoTalk), an AI-in-the-loop methodology designed to maximize\nthe number of annotated samples and improve their comprehensiveness under fixed\nbudget constraints (e.g., total human annotation time). The framework is built\nupon two key insights. First, sequential annotation reduces redundant workload\ncompared to conventional parallel annotation, as subsequent annotators only\nneed to annotate the ``residual'' -- the missing visual information that\nprevious annotations have not covered. Second, humans process textual input\nfaster by reading while outputting annotations with much higher throughput via\ntalking; thus a multimodal interface enables optimized efficiency. We evaluate\nour framework from two aspects: intrinsic evaluations that assess the\ncomprehensiveness of semantic units, obtained by parsing detailed captions into\nobject-attribute trees and analyzing their effective connections; extrinsic\nevaluation measures the practical usage of the annotated captions in\nfacilitating vision-language alignment. Experiments with eight participants\nshow our Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) improves annotation speed (0.42 vs. 0.30\nunits/sec) and retrieval performance (41.13\\% vs. 40.52\\%) over the parallel\nmethod."}

To address this challenge, multimodal\ndata synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data\nadhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. In this work, we\nintroduce SKG2Data, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial\nknowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation.\nSKG2Data automatically constructs a Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) to emulate\nhuman-like perception of spatial directions and distances, which is\nsubsequently utilized to guide multimodal data synthesis. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge,\nincluding direction and distance, not only enhance the spatial perception and\nreasoning abilities of MLLMs but also exhibit strong generalization\ncapabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can\nadvance the development of spatial intelligence."}
