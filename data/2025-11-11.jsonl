Secondly,\nGaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity\nof predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly\nmodeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\\text{trunc}}$ instead of using\nsampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is\nproposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending\nsemantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM). Comprehensive\nevaluations on LIDC and ISIC3 datasets demonstrate that ATFM outperforms SOTA\nmethods and simultaneously achieves a more efficient inference.

This paper investigates a novel and\npractical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs\nfine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task,\ntraining data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional\ntransfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we\ndemonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the\nVFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a\ntemporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal\nrepresentation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA\nintegrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the\ndiscrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a\ntemporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential\nimpact of perturbations.

We then embed each motion into a latent vector and train a shared\nmotion decoder to learn the distribution of motions represented by a structured\nand compact motion representation, i.e., neural key point trajectories. The\ncanonical 3D Gaussians are then driven by these key points and fused to model\nthe geometry and appearance. During inference time with learned latent space,\nwe can instantly sample diverse 3D motions in a single-forward pass and support\nseveral interesting applications including 3D motion interpolation and\nlanguage-guided motion generation.

The ability to perceive, track, and manipulate\nthese objects without prior knowledge of their geometry or kinematic properties\nremains a fundamental challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a novel\nmethod for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or\narticulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge\nregarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed\nArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point\nclouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for\npoint cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints\nin objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or\nhold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop\na closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to\nmove the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively\nevaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot\nexperiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating\nobjects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging\nvisual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard\ndataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms\nof pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This has led to incremental improvements without a deep\nunderstanding of the current failures. While it is straightforward to look at\nsituations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying\nreason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the\nmodel are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a\nlightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous\ndriving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled\nanalysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location\nor adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To\ntackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0,\nwe introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance\non Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis\nexposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by\nlow obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable\nshortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories. Based on\nthese findings, we argue for a shift toward data-centric development, with a\nfocus on richer, more robust, and less biased datasets. We open-source our code\nand model at https://github.com/autonomousvision/plant2."}

Akshay", "Ashutosh Gupta"], "title": "Verifying rich robustness properties for neural networks", "categories": ["cs.LO", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Robustness is a important problem in AI alignment and safety, with models\nsuch as neural networks being increasingly used in safety-critical systems. In\nthe last decade, a large body of work has emerged on local robustness, i.e.,\nchecking if the decision of a neural network remains unchanged when the input\nis slightly perturbed. However, many of these approaches require specialized\nencoding and often ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In\nthis paper, our goal is to build a generalized framework to specify and verify\nvariants of robustness in neural network verification. We propose a\nspecification framework using a simple grammar, which is flexible enough to\ncapture most existing variants. This allows us to introduce new variants of\nrobustness that take into account the confidence of the neural network in its\noutputs. Next, we develop a novel and powerful unified technique to verify all\nsuch variants in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to\nthe neural network. This enables us to use any state-of-the-art neural network\nverification tool, without having to tinker with the encoding within, while\nincurring an approximation error that we show is bounded. We perform an\nextensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks having\n138M parameters in a largest network, and show that we are able to capture a\nwide set of robustness variants and outperform direct encoding approaches by a\nsignificant margin."}

The new set-up involves a\ntemplate-driven generator, runner, and evaluation framework that, through\nsystematic permutations of convolutional, normalization, activation, and\ndropout layers, can create more than 1,200 variants of neural networks. Fractal\ntemplates allow for structural recursion and multi-column pathways, thus,\nmodels become deeper and wider in a balanced way. Training utilizes PyTorch,\nAutomatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and gradient checkpointing and is carried out\non the CIFAR-10 dataset for five epochs. The outcomes show that fractal-based\narchitectures are capable of strong performance and are computationally\nefficient. The paper positions fractal design as a feasible and\nresource-efficient method of automated architecture exploration."}

Recent video generation models can\nsynthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and\nimages, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for\nrobotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to\nrobots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld\naddresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world\nreconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates\ntask-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the\nvideos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate\nactions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the\nphysical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into\nphysically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot\ndata collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation.\nExperiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld\nsubstantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.\nVisit \\href{https://pointscoder.github.io/PhysWorld_Web/}{the project webpage}\nfor details."}
