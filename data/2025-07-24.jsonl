The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to\ngenerate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we\nfirst employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.\nThis results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine\ncrack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The\ndifference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a\nfine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is\nunaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting.

However, learning foundation models\nexclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to\nlearn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,\naiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data\nfor foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a\nsynergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training\nframework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge\nin combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model\nlies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.\nTo address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the\nCLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic\nspecific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for\nsemantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation\nloss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature\nspace back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With\nthis mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both\npaired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for\ndownstream tasks. Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and data efficiency of our method."}
