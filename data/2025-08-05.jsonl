To address these challenges, we\npropose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based\ninpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also\nsupports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated\ninto various community models.

When integrated with standard BP,\nENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image\nclassification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations\ngeneralize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.\nFurthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,\nbackpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\\ell$. This variant\nnot only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\\times$\ntraining speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy\nof end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm\nthat directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to\nenhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training\nregime."}

Secondly, we present an \"inverse\nprompt\" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,\ninverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a\nnovel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs\nby marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial\ndimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of\nregistering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,\nas a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and\ntarget registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration\noutperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based\nDDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with\nweakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data."}

To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided\nTransformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of\nthe current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and\ndependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns\npredefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using\ntransformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead.

Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them.

COSFormer is designed to learn\nsequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical\ndatasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering\nseven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and\ntask-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior\ngeneralizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning\nframeworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in\nclinical applications."}

Unlike existing\nspherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as\ndiscrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as\na spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).\nGiven the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment\nalgorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit\nvectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical\nPattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a\nhybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two\nmethods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in\ncorrespondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x\nmore accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with\noutliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new\ndataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.\n\"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud\nRegistration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images."}

Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of\n3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving\nML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic\ntesting."}

UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical\napplications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate\nthe variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain\npixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of\nerror and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty\ninformation. This representation is obtained by projection of training error\nand visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained\nby rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel\nviews, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty\nfeature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout\ndata. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method,\ninvestigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression\nmodels. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into\nforeground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors,\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The\ntrained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes,\nallowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data."}

However,\nthese approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the\nclinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to\nmake diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or\n``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these\nnuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for\nhandling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the\nproblem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important\nissue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better\nincorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image\nanalysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of\nclinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert\nuncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which\nsignificantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art\napproaches."}

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training\ndata-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration\nchallenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems\ntailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose\nQuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for\nquadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of\nquadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,\nproviding a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively\ncapture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during\nquadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts\ncontrollable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and\nprovides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video\ngeneration under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller\n(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter\ncontrol through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in\nwide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream\narchitecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail\nenhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.\nWe further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training\ndata for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the\nperformance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice\nAttribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model\nrecognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted\nby a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized\nclassifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which\nidentifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition\n(ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve\nrobustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection\nthresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong\nperformance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all\ndatasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes.\nAdditional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation\nanalysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability.

In\ncontrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker\nexpression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly\nand time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To\naddress this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising\nalternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of\nsynthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving\nstructural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this\nend, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and\nevaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining\nrestoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image\nrestoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways,\nStar-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker\nvariability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC\npatches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a\nclinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic\ndegradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level\nmetrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment\nand classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that\nStar-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity\nand diagnostic relevance.

Integrating\ncomplementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation\naccuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods\nface several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities\nhinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack\nadaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are\ndecoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a\ndual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature\nalignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal\n3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network\nto process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign\nmodule between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention\nmechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a\nreinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that\nconsistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features\nare then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an\nensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from\nindividual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental\nresults on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the\nproposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nDice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach."}

This framework establishes\nverifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal\nsources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical\nlesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals\nsystematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM\nconsistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest\nincompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate\nthat these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design\nprinciples tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for\nneuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,\nwhich makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently\naccurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this\ndomain shift.
