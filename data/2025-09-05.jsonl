Our\nfindings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which\nenable them to converge more stably by ``refining\" their innate features, and\nultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.\n  Based on these findings, we introduce \\textbf{FE2E}, a framework that\npioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer\n(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the\neditor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow\nmatching loss into the ``consistent velocity\" training objective. And we use\nlogarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's\nnative BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.\nAdditionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint\nestimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their\nsupervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.\n  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance\nimprovements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple\ndatasets.

While recent generative models\noffer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult\ndue to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global\n(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose\nLuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion\ntransformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.\nTrained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our\nmodel learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes\neffectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the\ninput and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation\nfinetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method\nproduces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency\ndetails, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations."}

A large model thus requires powerful GPUs\nwith high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering\nlatencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this\nwork, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed\n3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a\nlittle loss in model quality.

To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that\neffectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these\ncompressed representations.

Understanding\nhow tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,\nhuman-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional\nAI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban\nquarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic\nquarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,\ncolor theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified\nfrom tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To\nassess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering\nmethod, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color\nthemes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street\nviews, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps\nbetween visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both\nstylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated\nthrough a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and\na multi-task BERT model.

The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and\nemotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this\nframework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist\nperception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage\nconservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces."}
