However, most navigation policies are sensitive to\nviewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that\nalter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized\nscenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View\nInvariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the\nrobustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL\nemploys a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant\nfeatures. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the\nWaypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a\nview-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student\nmodel. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these\ncomponents, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical\nresults show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on\nV2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets\nR2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE\nsetting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often\nstill improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method\nalso achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to\nother map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the\nstandard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training\nmethod."}

This reduces input sequence length by up\nto 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage\nand better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic\nmodalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,\nalong with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and\nintermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment\nwithout relying on gloss-level supervision.

While several anomaly\nsynthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often\nstruggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a\nregion-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA\nleverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate\nrealistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small\nnumber of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition\nto jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,\nenabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then\nutilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained\nsemantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of\nanomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy\nensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,\nwhile a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve\nthe overall quality of the generated samples.

Our method uses an iterative\nin-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,\nboundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise\nadjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,\neffectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully\nsynthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label\nfeatures derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between\nnear-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,\nwith minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly\nsurpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by\n11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD."}

Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems.

To address these limitations, we\npropose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment\n(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints\nto significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image\nconsistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach\nintegrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned\nchallenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic\nAlignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and\ncomparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and\nthe Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which\ndraws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing\nfrequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to\nbetter quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of\nfine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted\non multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.

In this\nwork, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models\nannotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our\npipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs\nto generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural\nlanguage descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this\napproach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail\nto reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and\ntopological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler\ncharacteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and\nablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that\nCADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of\nnew objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online."}
