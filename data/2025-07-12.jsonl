While current markerless methods\nmostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored\nin this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.\n  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung\ntumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are\nevaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)\napproach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)\nmodel designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the\nlimited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment\nsessions.\n  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning\n4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was\nheld out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's\nplanning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion\nover a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement\nError (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and\ntreatment (T2) data.\n  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set\nsizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,\nMP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical\nvariability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.\n  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless\ntumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models\noffer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained\nclinical settings."}

We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that\nthey fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the\nonline setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and\nthe memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common\nerror patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial\nreasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly\ndrop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core\nchallenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To\nfoster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and\nbenchmark are available. Our project page is:\nhttps://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/"}

Despite their popularity, their representations show major\nlimitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,\nas a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of \"a yellow\nsubmarine and a blue bus\" or \"a blue submarine and a yellow bus\". Previous\nattempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the\narchitecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect\nthat the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in\nthe arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this\nwork, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data\nproperties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We\nfind that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,\nincomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to\ndescribe the object that is \"most salient\" to them have a detrimental effect on\nbinding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling\nthe batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly\ncreating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the\ndata expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect\nbinding."}

Among various\napproaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate\nforgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.\nHowever, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within\nthe replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and\nnewly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing\ndata replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination\nmechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning\nobjective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has\ntwo key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs\nglobal representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then\nguides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve\nbalanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the\ntask aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of\nlogits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces\nthe model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity\nto minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves\nbalanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and\nimproves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,\nyielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods."}

However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training\nobjective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise\nvulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well\ndistinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while\nclasses with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain\ndisproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong\nclasses do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust\nfeatures are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from\nstronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that\nadaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting\nfeature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted\nadversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further\nincorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,\nbuilding on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.\nComprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,\nincluding evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,\ndemonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both\nclean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and\npreserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step\ntoward fair and effective adversarial defense."}

Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by\nusing an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by\ndistribution shifts between the source and target.

To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach\ncalled Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the\nconcurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that\npredicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks\nduring test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional\nmulti-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols.

These datasets are precisely annotated and closely\nmimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset\npresents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence\nintensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning\nhas shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often\ndeclines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we\ndeveloped a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation\nResidual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet).

Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and\nquantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,\nnamely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,\nparticularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,\nwere largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created.
