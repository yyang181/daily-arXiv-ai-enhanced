The nature of these operators are demonstrated\nvia an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of\nsamples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the\nregion of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken\nslice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental\ntheorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations\nwe observe that the various operators have their own significance while\nstudying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an\nimage (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work\nwell and some do not for some specific features of the image."}

To address this limitation, we propose\nHRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose\nestimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud\nrepresentations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples\nobject pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately\nencoded and leveraged throughout the network.

We further design pose\nestimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and\ntranslation-aware embeddings.

With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at\nscale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans\ndevelop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how\nintelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,\nVirtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator\nthat supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A\nlarge-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast\noutdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with\nrich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two\nnovel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent\nreasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to\nhelp agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The\nCommunity Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate\nin solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these\ntasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task\nplanning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community\nwill unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world\nenvironments."}

Its\ndifficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image\nsequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance\nbetween these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image\nCaptioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant\nstudies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach\naccelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and\nreproducible by anyone interested.

Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms\nexisting representative methods in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc, demonstrating\nstronger lesion recognition accuracy and robustness. In particular, the model\nachieves better boundary reconstruction and structural recovery in complex\nscenarios, making it well-suited for the key demands of automated segmentation\ntasks in skin lesion analysis."}

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many\nof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.\nThese limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's\ninfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive\nlearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive\nexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark\ndatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset\nselection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale\nvision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data\npoints and outperforms strong baselines."}

However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition\nhave hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large\nrepositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting\nopportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage\nrecent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling\ncomplex data distributions utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a\ntarget domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual\nmultiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate\nmultiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our\napproach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion\nmodel on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers.\nTo tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different\nmarker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for\nsingle-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference\nefficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two\npublicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in\ngenerating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a\nsubstantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches.\nThis validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual\nmultiplex staining.

These sensory-rich modalities are beyond\nthe scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present\nShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data\nscarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text\nand 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and\nphysiological signals.

As squeezing\nenhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling\nnoise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning\nimportant data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg\ndiffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse\nscaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales\nonly the principal axis.
