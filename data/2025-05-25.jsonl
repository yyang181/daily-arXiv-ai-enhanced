Effective VQA necessitates sensitivity to pixel-level distortions\nand a comprehensive understanding of video context to accurately determine the\nperceptual impact of distortions. Traditional hand-crafted and learning-based\nVQA models mainly focus on pixel-level distortions and lack contextual\nunderstanding, while recent LLM-based models struggle with sensitivity to small\ndistortions or handle quality scoring and description as separate tasks. To\naddress these shortcomings, we introduce CP-LLM: a Context and Pixel aware\nLarge Language Model. CP-LLM is a novel multimodal LLM architecture featuring\ndual vision encoders designed to independently analyze perceptual quality at\nboth high-level (video context) and low-level (pixel distortion) granularity,\nalong with a language decoder subsequently reasons about the interplay between\nthese aspects. This design enables CP-LLM to simultaneously produce robust\nquality scores and interpretable quality descriptions, with enhanced\nsensitivity to pixel distortions (e.g. compression artifacts). The model is\ntrained via a multi-task pipeline optimizing for score prediction, description\ngeneration, and pairwise comparisons.

This paper proposes a novel shape-aware TBP\nsystem automatically capturing full-body images while optimizing image quality\nin terms of resolution and sharpness over the body surface.

An alternative measure that can provide a\nrelatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility\nis myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with\nmyocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac\nfunction. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from\ncine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain\ncalculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential\nframes, which can be accomplished using registration models.

In\nthis work, we revisit the design of a diffusion-based codec and argue that\nmulti-step sampling is not necessary for generative compression. Based on this\ninsight, we propose OneDC, a One-step Diffusion-based generative image Codec --\nthat integrates a latent compression module with a one-step diffusion\ngenerator. Recognizing the critical role of semantic guidance in one-step\ndiffusion, we propose using the hyperprior as a semantic signal, overcoming the\nlimitations of text prompts in representing complex visual content. To further\nenhance the semantic capability of the hyperprior, we introduce a semantic\ndistillation mechanism that transfers knowledge from a pretrained generative\ntokenizer to the hyperprior codec. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid pixel- and\nlatent-domain optimization to jointly enhance both reconstruction fidelity and\nperceptual realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneDC achieves SOTA\nperceptual quality even with one-step generation, offering over 40% bitrate\nreduction and 20x faster decoding compared to prior multi-step diffusion-based\ncodecs. Code will be released later."}

In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that\ntransforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative\ndialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character\nexpression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the\nfirst defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior.\nWhile a story generation model such as Text2Story generates the corresponding\nvisual scene, we focus on generating expressive character utterances from these\nprompts and the scene image. We apply a pretrained vision-language encoder to\nextract a high-level semantic feature from the representative frame, capturing\nsalient visual context. This feature is then combined with the structured\nprompts and used to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural,\ncharacter-consistent dialogue. To ensure contextual consistency across scenes,\nwe introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank that conditions each dialogue\ngeneration on the accumulated dialogue history from prior scenes. This approach\nenables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals and\ninteractions throughout a story. Finally, we render each utterance as\nexpressive, character-consistent speech, resulting in fully-voiced video\nnarratives. Our framework requires no additional training and demonstrates\napplicability across a variety of story settings, from fantasy adventures to\nslice-of-life episodes."}

In autoregressive models, the number of forward iterations during\ngeneration equals the response length. With confident decoding, however, the\nnumber of iterations needed by Dimple is even only $\\frac{\\text{response\nlength}}{3}$. We also re-implement the prefilling technique in autoregressive\nmodels and demonstrate that it does not significantly impact performance on\nmost benchmark evaluations, while offering a speedup of 1.5x to 7x.\nAdditionally, we explore Dimple's capability to precisely control its response\nusing structure priors. These priors enable structured responses in a manner\ndistinct from instruction-based or chain-of-thought prompting, and allow\nfine-grained control over response format and length, which is difficult to\nachieve in autoregressive models.

Inspired by the top-down mechanism in the\nbrain, we introduce TDFormer, a novel model with a top-down feedback structure\nthat functions hierarchically and leverages high-order representations from\nearlier time steps to modulate the processing of low-order information at later\nstages. The feedback structure plays a role from two perspectives: 1) During\nforward propagation, our model increases the mutual information across time\nsteps, indicating that richer temporal information is being transmitted and\nintegrated in different time steps. 2) During backward propagation, we\ntheoretically prove that the feedback structure alleviates the problem of\nvanishing gradients along the time dimension. We find that these mechanisms\ntogether significantly and consistently improve the model performance on\nmultiple datasets. In particular, our model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on ImageNet with an accuracy of 86.83%."}

Inspired by the\nhuman-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but\nthink carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when\nreasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training\nstrategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective\n'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with\nempty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold\nstart for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to\nfreely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome\nrewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by\nup to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even\nimproving it. Further evaluations across diverse vision-language tasks-covering\na range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently\nreveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning\nsteps as training advances.

In this paper, we observe that\nbackdoor triggers systematically disrupt cross-modal processing by causing\nabnormal attention concentration on non-semantic regions--a phenomenon we term\nattention collapse. Based on this insight, we propose Believe Your Eyes (BYE),\na data filtering framework that leverages attention entropy patterns as\nself-supervised signals to identify and filter backdoor samples.
