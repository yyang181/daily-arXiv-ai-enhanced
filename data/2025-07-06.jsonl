For the final\nkeypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint\nproposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly\ninterpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect\npredefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically\ndiscover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves\nstrong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model."}

To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named\nAvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup\npatterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a\ncoarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,\nand then to refine the details.

Due to the uncertainties in diffusion\nprocess, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and\nexpressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely\napply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and\nmultiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding\nthe averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying\nthe global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from\narbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar.

However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations.

This\noverlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift\npermanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid\nadaptation.\n  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift\nthat simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a\nbaseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained\nfrom scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While\neffective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment\n(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a\ndrift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of\ndrifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number\nof up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new\ndistribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while\nreducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.\n  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants\nof standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and\nTiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted\nrepresentations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several\nrehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,\nmaintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as\na scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary\ncontinual learning environments."}

Accurate\nkinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally\nachieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small\nanimals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,\nprecluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully\nconvolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions\ndirectly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling\nin dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial\nfeature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,\nextracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a\ntemporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The\nproposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood\ncurves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model\napplicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected\nusing two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The\nmodel was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate\nshorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts\nthe arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.\nFurthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function\neven from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF\nfrom samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not\nrepresented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers\na non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving\nrobust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations."}

However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only\ntwo-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making\nit challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical\nparameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging\nprovides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low\nspatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for\nreconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are\nfrequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction\npipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose\nestimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an\nimplicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into\na personalized 3D heart model.\n  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the\nreconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume\nestimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\\% VS. 20.24\\%). In\naddition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important\nbreakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of\n5.75\\% ).
