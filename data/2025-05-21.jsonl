To create high-fidelity game\ncontent that simultaneously aligns with player preferences and significantly\nboosts designer efficiency, we present Hunyuan-Game, an innovative project\ndesigned to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses\ntwo primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image\ngeneration component is built upon a vast dataset comprising billions of game\nimages, leading to the development of a group of customized image generation\nmodels tailored for game scenarios: (1) General Text-to-Image Generation. (2)\nGame Visual Effects Generation, involving text-to-effect and reference\nimage-based game visual effect generation. (3) Transparent Image Generation for\ncharacters, scenes, and game visual effects. (4) Game Character Generation\nbased on sketches, black-and-white images, and white models. The video\ngeneration component is built upon a comprehensive dataset of millions of game\nand anime videos, leading to the development of five core algorithmic models,\neach targeting critical pain points in game development and having robust\nadaptation to diverse game video scenarios: (1) Image-to-Video Generation. (2)\n360 A/T Pose Avatar Video Synthesis. (3) Dynamic Illustration Generation. (4)\nGenerative Video Super-Resolution. (5) Interactive Game Video Generation. These\nimage and video generation models not only exhibit high-level aesthetic\nexpression but also deeply integrate domain-specific knowledge, establishing a\nsystematic understanding of diverse game and anime art styles."}

Controlling the motion of\nsubjects in videos using only prompts is challenging, especially when it comes\nto describing complex movements. Further, existing methods fail to control the\nmotion in image-to-video generation, as the subject in the reference image\noften differs from the subject in the reference video in terms of initial\nposition, size, and shape. To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion\nPrior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses\nthe powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to\nenable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos\nin both text-to-video and image-to-video generation.

Standard VAEs generate dispersed and unstructured\nlatent spaces by utilizing all dimensions, which limits their interpretability,\nespecially in high-dimensional spaces. To address this challenge, Variational\nSparse Coding (VSC) introduces a spike-and-slab prior distribution, resulting\nin sparse latent representations for each input. These sparse representations,\ncharacterized by a limited number of active dimensions, are inherently more\ninterpretable. Despite this advantage, VSC falls short in providing structured\ninterpretations across samples within the same class. Intuitively, samples from\nthe same class are expected to share similar attributes while allowing for\nvariations in those attributes. This expectation should manifest as consistent\npatterns of active dimensions in their latent representations, but VSC does not\nenforce such consistency.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the latent space\ninterpretability by ensuring that the active dimensions in the latent space are\nconsistent across samples within the same class. To achieve this, we introduce\na new loss function that encourages samples from the same class to share\nsimilar active dimensions. This alignment creates a more structured and\ninterpretable latent space, where each shared dimension corresponds to a\nhigh-level concept, or \"factor.\" Unlike existing disentanglement-based methods\nthat primarily focus on global factors shared across all classes, our method\ncaptures both global and class-specific factors, thereby enhancing the utility\nand interpretability of latent representations."}

However, most tools for estimating cortical surfaces work\nexclusively on scans with at least 1 mm isotropic resolution and are tuned to a\nspecific magnetic resonance (MR) contrast, often T1-weighted (T1w). This\nprecludes application using most clinical MR scans, which are very\nheterogeneous in terms of contrast and resolution. Here, we use synthetic\ndomain-randomized data to train the first neural network for explicit\nestimation of cortical surfaces from scans of any contrast and resolution,\nwithout retraining. Our method deforms a template mesh to the white matter (WM)\nsurface, which guarantees topological correctness. This mesh is further\ndeformed to estimate the GM surface. We compare our method to\nrecon-all-clinical (RAC), an implicit surface reconstruction method which is\ncurrently the only other tool capable of processing heterogeneous clinical MR\nscans, on ADNI and a large clinical dataset (n=1,332). We show a approximately\n50 % reduction in cortical thickness error (from 0.50 to 0.24 mm) with respect\nto RAC and better recovery of the aging-related cortical thinning patterns\ndetected by FreeSurfer on high-resolution T1w scans.

We term such transitions as coordinated interactions\nand decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous\nmethods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are\ncritical for multiple characters.
