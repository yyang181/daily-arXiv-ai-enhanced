Existing approaches typically rely on feature\nextraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these\nprocesses are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex\nenvironments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview\npoint cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a\ndepth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least\nsquares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the\nglobal map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which\nrely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses\nthese challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth\nmap through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly\nincorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive\nevaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging\nenvironments where feature extraction and data association are difficult."}

PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses\nperceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human\nvisual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is\ninterpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well\nsuited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM\non four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate\nthat it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high\ncompression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both\nstructured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool\nfor analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online\nplatforms."}

Unlike existing\nmethods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention\nmechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale\nfeature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and\nintegrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.\nA block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT\nthat reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a\nmulti-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing\nhierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation\nand 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like\nthe Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation\naccuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal\nthat integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature\nextraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional\nsupervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that\nHMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating\nits potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications."}

Nevertheless, the\nincreasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning\nguidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet\nbeen explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for\nultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for\nultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a\ntransformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object\ndetection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user\nquery is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through\nLLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding\nultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,\nassisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical\nexploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning\nguidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,\nincluding the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers.

Xray2Xray captures the latent representations of the chest volume\nby modeling the transition dynamics of X-ray projections across different\nangular positions with a vision model and a transition model. We employed the\nlatent representations of Xray2Xray for downstream risk prediction and disease\ndiagnosis tasks. Experimental results showed that Xray2Xray outperformed both\nsupervised methods and self-supervised pretraining methods for cardiovascular\ndisease risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in classifying\nfive pathologies in CXRs. We also assessed the quality of Xray2Xray's latent\nrepresentations through synthesis tasks and demonstrated that the latent\nrepresentations can be used to reconstruct volumetric context."}

These failure modes\nhave largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether\nthey reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these\nmodels. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and\ncharacterizing \"conceptual blindspots\" -- concepts present in the training data\nbut absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages\nsparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,\nenabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and\ngenerated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with\n32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained\nanalysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models\n(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals\nspecific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces\non documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and\npalm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization\nartifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates\nseen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework\nfor systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by\nassessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying\ndata-generating process."}

This\npaper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight\napproach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step\ngenerators without requiring access to original training images or retraining\nthe base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and\nemploys a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator.

Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as\nminimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the\nconditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,\ndata-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step\ngenerator and a control signal model.

NeRF-based methods\nhave achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a\nlocal-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash\nencoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a\nsubset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all\nparameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash\nfeatures generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from\ndifferent subsets of the hash encoder.

We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends\nsingle-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient\npost-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame\npretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens\nprediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)\nmulti-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from\ndiscrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating\nmotion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame\ndecoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared\ndecoder with cross-attention.
