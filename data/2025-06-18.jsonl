For this purpose, we consider the Delaunay\ntriangulation of template features as an useful tool through which to be guided\nin this iterative approach. The triangulation is treated as a graph and,\nstarting from a single triangle, neighboring nodes are considered and the\ncorresponding features are identified; then matches related to them are\nevaluated to determine if they are worthy to be grouped. This evaluation is\nbased on local consistency criteria derived from geometric and photometric\nproperties of local features. Our solution allows the identification of the\nobject in situations where geometric models (e.g. homography) does not hold,\nthus enable the detection of objects such that the template is non planar or\nwhen it is planar but appears distorted in the image. We show that our approach\nperforms just as well or better than application of homography-based RANSAC in\nscenarios in which distortion is nearly absent, while when the deformation\nbecomes relevant our method shows better description performance."}

To address this problem, this study\nproposes a Multi-stage Augmented Multimodal Interaction Network (MAINet) for\nquantifying fish feeding intensity.

Typically, the inner product\nperformed in the Euclidean space calculates the algebraic\n  similarity rather than the semantic similarity, which results in undesired\nattention output and a decrease in fusion performance.\n  While the balance of low-level details and high-level semantics should be\nconsidered in infrared and visible image fusion task. To\n  address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism\nbased on Grassmann manifold for infrared and visible\n  image fusion (GrFormer). Specifically, our method constructs a low-rank\nsubspace mapping through projection constraints on the\n  Grassmann manifold, compressing attention features into subspaces of varying\nrank levels. This forces the features to decouple into\n  high-frequency details (local low-rank) and low-frequency semantics (global\nlow-rank), thereby achieving multi-scale semantic\n  fusion. Additionally, to effectively integrate the significant information,\nwe develop a cross-modal fusion strategy (CMS) based on\n  a covariance mask to maximise the complementary properties between different\nmodalities and to suppress the features with high\n  correlation, which are deemed redundant.

Author version of article to appear at CCS 2025", "summary": "We show the security risk associated with using machine learning classifiers\nin United States election tabulators. The central classification task in\nelection tabulation is deciding whether a mark does or does not appear on a\nbubble associated to an alternative in a contest on the ballot. Barretto et al.\n(E-Vote-ID 2021) reported that convolutional neural networks are a viable\noption in this field, as they outperform simple feature-based classifiers.\n  Our contributions to election security can be divided into four parts. To\ndemonstrate and analyze the hypothetical vulnerability of machine learning\nmodels on election tabulators, we first introduce four new ballot datasets.\nSecond, we train and test a variety of different models on our new datasets.\nThese models include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (a\nbasic CNN, VGG and ResNet), and vision transformers (Twins and CaiT). Third,\nusing our new datasets and trained models, we demonstrate that traditional\nwhite box attacks are ineffective in the voting domain due to gradient masking.\nOur analyses further reveal that gradient masking is a product of numerical\ninstability. We use a modified difference of logits ratio loss to overcome this\nissue (Croce and Hein, ICML 2020). Fourth, in the physical world, we conduct\nattacks with the adversarial examples generated using our new methods. In\ntraditional adversarial machine learning, a high (50% or greater) attack\nsuccess rate is ideal. However, for certain elections, even a 5% attack success\nrate can flip the outcome of a race. We show such an impact is possible in the\nphysical domain. We thoroughly discuss attack realism, and the challenges and\npracticality associated with printing and scanning ballot adversarial examples."}

VCEs complement\nother types of explanations, such as feature attribution, by revealing the\nspecific data transformations to which a machine learning model responds most\nstrongly. In this paper, we argue that existing VCEs focus too narrowly on\noptimizing sample quality or change minimality; they fail to consider the more\nholistic desiderata for an explanation, such as fidelity, understandability,\nand sufficiency. To address this shortcoming, we explore new mechanisms for\ncounterfactual generation and investigate how they can help fulfill these\ndesiderata. We combine these mechanisms into a novel 'smooth counterfactual\nexplorer' (SCE) algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness through systematic\nevaluations on synthetic and real data."}

Producing high-quality\nreconstructions typically requires many X-ray measurements; this process can be\nslow and expensive, especially for dense materials. Recent work incorporating\nartifact reduction priors within a plug-and-play (PnP) reconstruction framework\nhas shown promising results in improving image quality from sparse-view XCT\nscans while enhancing the generalizability of deep learning-based solutions.\nHowever, this method uses a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for artifact\nreduction, which captures only slice-independent information from the 3D\nreconstruction, limiting performance. In this paper, we propose a PnP\nreconstruction method that uses a 2.5D artifact reduction CNN as the prior.\nThis approach leverages inter-slice information from adjacent slices, capturing\nricher spatial context while remaining computationally efficient. We show that\nthis 2.5D prior not only improves the quality of reconstructions but also\nenables the model to directly suppress commonly occurring XCT artifacts (such\nas beam hardening), eliminating the need for artifact correction\npre-processing. Experiments on both experimental and synthetic cone-beam XCT\ndata demonstrate that the proposed method better preserves fine structural\ndetails, such as pore size and shape, leading to more accurate defect detection\ncompared to 2D priors. In particular, we demonstrate strong performance on\nexperimental XCT data using a 2.5D artifact reduction prior trained entirely on\nsimulated scans, highlighting the proposed method's ability to generalize\nacross domains."}
