While\nrecent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic\nscenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically\nconsistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address\nthis, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D\nconsistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap\nalignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to\nlearn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future\nvideo sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D\nobservations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing\nbaselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned\npredictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets.

Firstly, we propose an\nEnhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information\nfrom motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.\nTo address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes\nthe leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the\nartifacts.

LCS programs herald a\ngenerational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related\nearly-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of\nradiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a\ncomputationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT\nanalysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can\nbe fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with\nlimited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained\nfrom scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,\nthereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label\nefficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of\nfine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000\nthoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public\ndatasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease\nclassification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,\nwhile generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a\nmasked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable\nsolution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive\nmodels by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest\ncomputational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays\nthe foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools\nthat could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular\nfocus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management\nin high-risk populations."}
