However, existing MIL methods often\nfail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both\nglobally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally\nthrough -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a\nprincipled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal\ndistribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel\nMIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv\nformulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two\nconstraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological\ndistributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by\nregulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware\nconstraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by\nprogressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT\nproblem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that\ncan be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.\nEmpirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular\nbenchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In\naddition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers\nhigh interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in\ndigital pathology.

Project page: https://stereodiff.github.io/", "summary": "Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following\nthe paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained\nvideo diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth\nestimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal\nconsistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are\nfundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically\nbackgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all\nframes, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for\ndynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to\nensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.\nBased on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth\nestimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with\nvideo depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic\nareas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth\ndiffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of\nboth. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth\nbenchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,\nshowcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation."}

This\npaper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most\ntrustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic\nreasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs).

To rigorously assess the validity of\nVLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid\nmetric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:\nsemantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on\nedge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.\nWe empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both\nambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield\nhigh TWS values.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way.

To better capture\nfine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)\nthat introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer\nto enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level\nfeatures to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel\nattention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and\nCross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and\nreduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in\nterms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and\nscales."}

In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also\nintroduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating\nmodels in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed\nmethod demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks\ncompared to other open-source omni-modal models."}

In addition,\nfour intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing\nconfiguration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of\ntotal vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic\nflow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that\nswitches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak\ntraffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic\ngenerator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and\na signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,\ndynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted\ndifferently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse\ntraffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4\nhours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions\naffect signal design selection.

However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank.

Many such publications use independent external specialists to\nreview submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are\ncalled referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee\nfor reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and\nthe number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these\npapers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts\nin all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should\nbe reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the\nbest reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.\n  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy\nto automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research\npaper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we\ncollect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the\nreferences. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic\nkeywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count\ntheir h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we\nrank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their\nhomepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and\ncolleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors,\ngenerally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research\npaper."}

Like professionals in the creative industries, such\ngeneration requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual\ndynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present\n\\textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for\nvideos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages:\nfoundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes,\ninteractive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and\ntargeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a\nmultimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning\nthat guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce\n\\textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning\nannotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual\ndescriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both\naudio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio\nbenchmark.

Humans form spatial mental models, internal\nrepresentations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and\nmotion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images\nexposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.\nUsing MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial\nmental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations\n(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for \"what-if\" movements).\nWe then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental\nmodels, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,\nand cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic\napproach, \"map-then-reason\", that jointly trains the model to first generate a\ncognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these\ninternal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding\nreinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our\nkey insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively\nconstructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with\nflexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of\nunobservable space."}

While increasing the\nnumber of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the\nframe rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.\nMoreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when\nacquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot\ndenoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances\ncontrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the\navailable transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form\ncompound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are\nthen used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,\nenabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical\nstructures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while\nthe underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows\nthe network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the\nconsistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no\ndomain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across\nanatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports\nefficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight\narchitecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on\nsimulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement\nand structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based\ndenoising methods."}
