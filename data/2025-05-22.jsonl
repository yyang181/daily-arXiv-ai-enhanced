Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text\nor visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated\nfour foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our\nexperiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs\ndocuments that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level\nofficial gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total.

Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with\ndisease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of\nfine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate\ntwo key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background\ntokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the\nglobal tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local\ndisease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and\ndisease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective\nDisease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a\nVLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies\ndisease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference. Without any\nadditional pixel-level annotations, DAP improves visual grounding accuracy by\n20.74% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three major chest X-ray\ndatasets."}

Therefore, we introduce InfoFD, a text-guided\nAI-generated image detection framework. InfoFD consists of two key components:\nthe Text-Guided Conditional Information Bottleneck (TGCIB) and Dynamic Text\nOrthogonalization (DTO). TGCIB improves the generalizability of learned\nrepresentations by conditioning on both text and class modalities. DTO\ndynamically updates weighted text features, preserving semantic information\nwhile leveraging the global \"bias\".

These challenges underscore the need for more\nefficient learning paradigms. In this work, we propose DC-Scene, a data-centric\nframework tailored for 3D scene understanding, which emphasizes enhancing data\nquality and training efficiency.

Fine-tuning such models for downstream\ntasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient framework to fine-tune SpectralGPT, a\nmultispectral foundation model, for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC).\nWe explore several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, including\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kronecker-based adaptation (KronA), Low-Rank\nKronecker (LoKr), and the recent LoRA+, which uses distinct learning rates for\nlow-rank adapters scaled by a factor lambda. Inspired by LoRA+, we introduce\nKronA+, which applies a similar mechanism to the Kronecker matrices. We\nevaluate our approach on five datasets from different sensors, showing\ncompetitive performance with state-of-the-art HSI models. Our full fine-tuning\n(FFT) setup for SpectralGPT even outperforms a dedicated hyperspectral\nfoundation model on some datasets while requiring only a quarter of the\ntraining epochs. Under the same number of epochs, KronA+ reaches similar\nperformance with far fewer trainable parameters - just 0.056 percent - and adds\nonly approximately 0.2 megabytes of storage, making it the most effective PEFT\nmethod tested."}

In addition, we performed a\ncomprehensive validation of the created OMNI dataset, including three CNN-based\nmethods, two Transformer-based methods, and one GNN-based method, and conducted\nautomated diagnostic experiments for malocclusion issues. The experimental\nresults show that the OMNI dataset can facilitate the automated diagnosis\nresearch of malocclusion issues and provide a new benchmark for the research in\nthis field.

In this work, such\ndisparities are exploited through a fresh perspective of non-linear feature\nsubspace. That is, a discriminative non-linear subspace is learned from InD\nfeatures to capture representative patterns of InD, while informative patterns\nof OoD features cannot be well captured in such a subspace due to their\ndifferent distribution. Grounded on this perspective, we exploit the deviations\nof InD and OoD features in such a non-linear subspace for effective OoD\ndetection. To be specific, we leverage the framework of Kernel Principal\nComponent Analysis (KPCA) to attain the discriminative non-linear subspace and\ndeploy the reconstruction error on such subspace to distinguish InD and OoD\ndata. Two challenges emerge: (i) the learning of an effective non-linear\nsubspace, i.e., the selection of kernel function in KPCA, and (ii) the\ncomputation of the kernel matrix with large-scale InD data. For the former, we\nreveal two vital non-linear patterns that closely relate to the InD-OoD\ndisparity, leading to the establishment of a Cosine-Gaussian kernel for\nconstructing the subspace. For the latter, we introduce two techniques to\napproximate the Cosine-Gaussian kernel with significantly cheap computations.\nIn particular, our approximation is further tailored by incorporating the InD\ndata confidence, which is demonstrated to promote the learning of\ndiscriminative subspaces for OoD data. Our study presents new insights into the\nnon-linear feature subspace for OoD detection and contributes practical\nexplorations on the associated kernel design and efficient computations,\nyielding a KPCA detection method with distinctively improved efficacy and\nefficiency."}
