While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content\nsynthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,\ntemporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing\nstable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate\ntalking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video\npreprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This\nframework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current\nlimitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating\noptimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline\nto extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region\nsegmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.\nTo ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling\nstrategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid\n(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion\nconsistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,\nthereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In\naddition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively\nrefine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video\ngeneration.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation\nquality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian\nwhile with 150 FPS inference speed.

A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend\ninpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when\nthere are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and\nperceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a\nreference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting\nsimilarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an\naccurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp\nthe reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the\noptimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies\nhave shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and\nappearance consistency of inpainted scenes."}
