We find\nsuch emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive\nvision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M,\ncomprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse\nbiological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on\nTreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training\nobjective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various\nbiological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We\nidentify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At\nthe inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns\nclosely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and\nhabitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the\nintra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better\nseparated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide\nformal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and\ncontrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties.

Foundation models offer a promising\nsolution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned\nfor specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for\nmedical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected\nnature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training\ntypically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large\nvolumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making\nfoundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we\npropose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy\nimaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while\ncontributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms,\nassessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on\ntask-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three\ncritical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and\ndemonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated,\nprivacy-preserving setting."}

The system operates\nin two phases. First, extracting text transcripts from video frames using a\nVision-Language Model (VLM). Next, processing questions using these transcripts\nto generate answers through a Large Language Model (LLM). This design ensures\nimage privacy by deploying the VLM on edge devices and the LLM in the cloud. To\nimprove transcript quality, we propose grid-based visual prompting, which\nextracts intricate local details from each grid cell and integrates them with\nglobal information. Evaluation results show that Grid-LoGAT, using the\nopen-source VLM (LLaVA-1.6-7B) and LLM (Llama-3.1-8B), outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods with similar baseline models on NExT-QA and STAR-QA\ndatasets with an accuracy of 65.9% and 50.11% respectively.

However, the high cost of manual annotation poses a challenge,\nhindering the scale of data and the ability of large models to enhance their\neffectiveness. Previous pseudo label generation methods heavily rely on\nhuman-labeled captions of the original dataset, limiting scalability and\ndiversity. To address this, we propose D2AF, a robust annotation framework for\nvisual grounding using only input images. This approach overcomes dataset size\nlimitations and enriches both the quantity and diversity of referring\nexpressions. Our approach leverages multimodal large models and object\ndetection models. By implementing dual-driven annotation strategies, we\neffectively generate detailed region-text pairs using both closed-set and\nopen-set approaches. We further conduct an in-depth analysis of data quantity\nand data distribution. Our findings demonstrate that increasing data volume\nenhances model performance.

The laborious\nand costly process of FACS coding has motivated the development of machine\nlearning frameworks for Action Unit (AU) detection. Despite intense efforts\nspanning three decades, the detection accuracy for many AUs is considered to be\nbelow the threshold needed for behavioral research. Also, many AUs are excluded\naltogether, making it impossible to fulfill the ultimate goal of FACS-the\nrepresentation of any facial expression in its entirety. This paper considers\nan alternative approach. Instead of creating automated tools that mimic FACS\nexperts, we propose to use a new coding system that mimics the key properties\nof FACS. Specifically, we construct a data-driven coding system called the\nFacial Basis, which contains units that correspond to localized and\ninterpretable 3D facial movements, and overcomes three structural limitations\nof automated FACS coding. First, the proposed method is completely\nunsupervised, bypassing costly, laborious and variable manual annotation.\nSecond, Facial Basis reconstructs all observable movement, rather than relying\non a limited repertoire of recognizable movements (as in automated FACS).\nFinally, the Facial Basis units are additive, whereas AUs may fail detection\nwhen they appear in a non-additive combination.

Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level\noptimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning\nthe distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested\noptimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a\npromising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean\nspace, treat data as independent and identically distributed points,\noverlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed\nHDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential\nvolume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like\nstructures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz\nhyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is\nmeasured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By\noptimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated\ninto the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards\nthe root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving\ntheir underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning\nin hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model\nperformance, while significantly improving training stability. Notably, HDD is\nseamlessly compatible with most existing DM methods, and extensive experiments\non different datasets validate its effectiveness."}
