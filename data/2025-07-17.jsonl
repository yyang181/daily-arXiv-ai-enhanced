To effectively address complex\nqueries involving spatial reference to other objects, we integrate the\nhierarchical scene graph with a Large Language Model for multistep reasoning.\nThis integration leverages inter-layer (e.g., room-to-object) and intra-layer\n(e.g., object-to-object) connections, enhancing spatial contextual\nunderstanding. We investigate the semantic and geometry accuracy of\nhierarchical representation on Habitat Matterport 3D Semantic multi-floor\nscenes. Our approach demonstrates efficient scene comprehension and robust\nobject grounding compared to existing methods. Overall OVIGo-3DHSG demonstrates\nstrong potential for applications requiring spatial reasoning and understanding\nof indoor environments.

Submitted to ICONIP 2025", "summary": "Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics,\nwith anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for\ninformation extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such\nas SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of\nthe box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the\nprompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to\nrecognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations\nfor diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has\nbeen trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their\nparts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic\nlandmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another\ngeneral-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection\nand can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO\nis efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in\nsegmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable\npipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical\nlandmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex\noutlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using\nYOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to\naccurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the\nproposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting\nanatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs."}

However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis\nmethods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between\nthe generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for\nreliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D\nWavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by\nperforming modality translation in a learned latent space.

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the\nimplications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected\ncoresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them.

In\nparticular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is\nbasically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined\nshape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and\nthe system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based\nface template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain\nsystems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based\nsecure and efficient face identification method with template protection.\nIDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching\non a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The\nfirst technique is a template representation transformation that sharply\nreduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient\nencoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving\nthe number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show\nthat IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted\ntemplates in 126ms, showing only 2X overhead compared to the identification\nover plaintexts."}

Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model\nmerging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the\nparameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on\ndifferent domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which\nminimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the\ndomain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge\nwhile maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant\nregardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.\nExperimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual\nlearning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its\neffectiveness in dynamic scenarios."}

While hippocampal\nneurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale\nneural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during\nnaturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we\ndemonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,\nfine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and\norientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited\nspatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent\nvisual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable\nspatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of\nspatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is\npresented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with\nintrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation\nthrough a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing\nto position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed\nyet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the\nbrain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under\npassive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and\npassive spatial cognition.
